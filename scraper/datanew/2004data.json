An interdisciplinary doctoral program in systems engineering, and a master's degree in Photonics are also available. The undergraduate curriculum evolves from a common core of social sciences, humanities, mathematics, natural sciences, and basic engineering courses. This core curriculum provides students with the rigorous foundation needed for the specific engineering disciplines. All of the programs of study provide students with the engineering science, design, and laboratory methods required to enter industry as fully productive engineers in their chosen fields. There are a variety of special programs available to undergraduates: a semester abroad program designed for second semester sophomores which enables engineering sophomores to incorporate a semester abroad experience while continuing normal progress toward the degree without additional cost; the B.S./M.S. program, whereby Boston University undergraduate students gain early admission to the Master's Degree program and complete both degrees in four or five years; the ENGMEDIC Program, which enables students interested in attending medical school to pursue an integrated curriculum and be admitted to  to the Boston University Medical School at the end of the sophomore year; and the B.U. Collaborative Degree Program which enables students to complete a second undergraduate degree at another school or college at Boston University. In addition, participation in the College's co-op program enables students to augment their coursework with practical experience in the workplace.  The College of Engineering offers opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in research through a variety of College and University programs including UROP (Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program), a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program.The graduate program offers numerous research opportunities in each of the College's four departments. Research opportunities also are available in the many research centers affiliated with the College, including the Photonics Center, the Center for Information Systems Engineering, the Center for Nanoscience and Nano-biotechnology, the Center for BioDynamics, the Biomolecular Engineering Research Center, the Center for Advanced Genomic Technology, the Hearing Research Center, the Neuromuscular Research Center, the Center for Advanced Biotechnology,the Center for Space Physics, and the Center for Computational Science.The Intercollegiate Program in Bioinformatics, offered jointly by the College of Engineering and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, integrates mathematics, computation, engineering, and the biological sciences.  Through coursework, collaborative training projects, industrial co-op, and MS and PhD dissertation research, students learn to apply analytic and computational methods and information technology to current problems in biology, chemistry, and biomedical engineering.The Late Entry Accelerated Program (LEAP) is designed for non-engineers who have at least a bachelor's degree in the liberal arts, the sciences, or another field.  Applicants who fit this criterion complete a non-degree sequence of courses in basic and advanced engineering at the undergraduate level, then receive direct admission to any regular Master of Science degree program offered by the College of Engineering.

We are committed to maintaining an environment that encourages faculty and students to be profound thinkers and practical doers.  Our world-class facilities provide over 340,000 square feet of interconnected labs, classrooms, clusters, and offices designed to encourage scientists to cut across boundaries and to collaborate.  Not surprisingly, we are situated among the buildings housing the University's Biology, Chemistry, Earth and Planetary Sciences, Mathematics, and Physics departments.With our broad aims, DEAS also serves as an integrator and a connector at Harvard.  We have close links with other departments like Physics and Earth and Planetary Sciences and have increasing ties with Chemistry, Biology, and Harvard's professional schools, especially medicine and business.  Through the Technology and Entrepreneurship Center (TECH), the Industrial Outreach Program (IOP) and the Harvard Industrial Partnership (HIP), we also look to collaborate with industry and business.The undergraduate program is within Harvard College's Faculty of Arts and Sciences.  Students tackle technical, yet socially relevant issues through coursework - solving the University's parking space problems in Engineering Sciences 96 or modeling college enrollment trends in Computer Science 96 - and by doing research and fieldwork on everything from computer security to water pollution.Undergraduates can study an enormous range of topics, including, Computer Science (artificial intelligence, graphics, languages, networking, systems, and theory of computation); Engineering Sciences (bioengineering, electrical and environmental engineering, and mechanical and materials science); and Applied Mathematics (with a focus on biology, chemistry, computer science, decision and control, economics, physics, social sciences, and engineering),In addition, students can design and pursue an individualized program that cuts across the disciplines to help them best prepare for a variety of careers and activities.  For instance, those concentrating in computer science might apply their knowledge to related fields like economics, linguistics, or even brain sciences through the interdisciplinary Mind, Brain, and Behavior Program. Some focus on electrical or mechanical engineering, bioengineering, or computing and communications, to enable them to move into related industry positions immediately after graduation.  Others take a more general approach, crafting a curriculum suitable for future graduate work in medicine, law, or business.Our faculty and graduate students tackle questions from a broad range of areas including, the physics and engineering of complex systems, quantum science and technology, new materials, systems biology, and bioengineering, computer science and information technology, electrical engineeirng, and energy and the environment.We are also the home of several research centers supported by the National Science Foundation, including the Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC), the Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center (NSEC), and serve as the Northeastern Regional Center for the U.S. Department of Energy funded National Institute of Global Environmental Change (NIGEC).Members of the DEAS have invented new types of lasers, stopped light in its tracks, created nanowires one-thousandth the width of a human hair, won a host of prestigious awards, and received major government and industry grants.

The VRAC facility also includes a flexible, \"immersive projection\" system that can create a viewing area as large as 36 feet wide and 10 feet tall\u2014equal to the area of over 400 standard 17-inch computer monitors.  This facility, called C4, can also be made into a 12-by-12 foot room with images projected onto three walls as well as the floor.  VRAC also hosts the C6, one of the world's leading VR facilities, with six-sided projection and wireless interaction devices.  A nearby auditorium is equipped with 3D projection and display capabilities, enabling large audiences to interact with virtual worlds.  3) Iowa State offers graduate certificates in Information Assurance and Power Systems Engineering to on- and off-campus students.  Graduate certificates provide students the opportunity to pursue prescribed and focus areas of study at the graduate level and earn a graduate credential from Iowa State's Graduate College.  Typical graduate certificates include nine to 12 credit hours of graduate work and may be completed in as little as one academic year.  Students who pursue graduate certificates complete graduate courses that may also be applied towards master's degree programs of study.  4) Iowa State offers off-campus credit courses leading to the master's degree in electrical engineering, computer engineering, mechanical engineering, and systems engineering at multiple sites across the nation.5) One of seven charter Centers of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education by the National Security Agency, Iowa State offers a multidisciplinary master's of science program that addresses technical and non-technical areas of the information assurance field.  Faculty members in six departments offer a set of interconnected courses that provide a firm grounding in information assurance, preparing students to embark on careers in information technology that focus on protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.6) To increase interest in graduate study in Iowa State's electrical engineering, computer engineering, or materials science and engineering departments, the concurrent BS/MS program allows undergraduate students the opportunity to sample graduate coursework and research.7) Iowa State's College of Engineering and the University of Iowa's Henry B. Tippie School of Management now offer an Executive Engineering Dual Master's Degree Program in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, created especially for mid- to upper-level engineering managers and executives.  In 26 months, students earn graduate degrees from two prestigious institutions: a master of engineering in systems engineering (MESE) from Iowa State and a master of business administration (MBA) from Iowa.8) Iowa State and the College of Engineering offer numerous development opportunities for student leaders. Leadership Advantage is an intensive three-day seminar exclusively for incoming students in engineering, architecture, and the technical sciences that focus on developing personal leadership skills, teaching awareness of leadership opportunities at Iowa State, and introducing students to the university and their specific fields of study. The College of Engineering also sponsors a leadership program exclusively for its students. The two-day workshop on early career development is followed by a seminar on leadership in the workplace. The Leadership through Engineering Academic Diversity (LEAD) program is committed to improving the educational experience and academic success, retention, and graduation of minority engineering students at Iowa State University. In addition, a variety of both discipline-specific clubs and general engineering honorary societies offer students numerous opportunities to build confidence and hone leadership skills.9) The College of Engineering encourages all majors to pursue opportunities for meaningful work experience before graduation through its cooperative education and internship programs. In 2003 the college placed 444 students in positions in industry, business, and government organizations related to their major fields of study\u2014an approximate six-fold increase since 1997. Co-op/intern students complete the same requirements for the bachelor's degree as students in other programs, while acquiring valuable practical work experience and demonstrated workplace skills. The value of co-op and intern experiences to new engineers is obvious in placement statistics: in the spring of 2004, for example, 85% of graduating seniors with co-op experience and 76% of graduating seniors with intern experience through the College of Engineering found employment upon graduating, compared to only 42% of students with no such experience.10) More than an exotic interlude in one's college career, for engineers, exposure to other peoples and cultures is critical to professional success in today's increasingly globalized economic and industrial sectors. The College of Engineering's International Programs & Services Department offers a host of international opportunities for students, from summer programs to full semesters and academic years abroad.  Summer programs, taught in English, are available in France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom. Study abroad during the regular academic year is offered in these nations and others, including Australia, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Scotland, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and Wales. During the 2003-\u00ac2004 academic year, over 150 students took advantage of the college's study and work abroad programs.  In addition, 35 foreign undergraduates studied in the college at least part of the year.", "freshmen_enroll_table": "none", "sophomore_enroll_table": "none", "junior_enroll_table": "none", "senior_enroll_table": "none", "teaching_tenure_table": [["Engineering Department(s)", "Hisp", "Am Ind", "Asian", "B/AfrA", "Haw", "White", "Oth", "Total Personnel"], ["M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F"], ["Aerospace Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "4", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "10", "0", "0", "0", "14", "0"], ["Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "3", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "5", "0", "0", "0", "8", "0"], ["Chemical Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "8", "1", "0", "0", "8", "1"], ["Civil, Construction, & Environmental Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "1", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "10", "0", "0", "0", "11", "0"], ["Electrical and Computer Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "4", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "10", "1", "0", "0", "14", "1"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing", "0", "0", "0", "0", "1", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "3", "1", "0", "0", "4", "1"], ["Interdepartmental", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0"], ["Materials Science and Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "1", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "13", "1", "0", "0", "14", "1"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "4", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "10", "1", "0", "0", "14", "1"], ["Pre-Engineering/Specials", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0"], ["Totals:", "0", "0", "0", "0", "18", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "69", "5", "0", "0", "87", "5"]], "tuition": ["5650", "15352"], "sat_scores": [["SAT", "75th", "25th"], ["Math Range:", "720", "620"], ["Reading Range:", "650", "530"], ["Combined Range:", "1380", "1170"]], "act_scores": [["ACT", "75th", "25th"], ["Math Range:", "31", "26"], ["Composite Range:", "29", "24"], ["Note: ACT Composite score for new Eng. freshmen was 26.36."]], "degree_table": "none"}, {"name": "John Brown University", "type": "PRIVATE", "undergrad_enroll": "1732", "graduate_enroll": "215", "description": "The purpose of the Division of Engineering and Technology is to provide a university education integrating general studies and disciplinary studies in such a way that the student may be competent in various engineering or construction activities.The faculty of the Division seeks to establish the student in the methods of carefully and logically understanding problems and then to proceed to design solutions for those problems.

The purpose of Mercer University's School of Engineering is to educate a student who is preparing to be a practicing engineer, one who can responsibly contribute to a global society that is becoming ever more dependent on technology.  The school offers rigorous engineering programs at the baccalaureate and master levels and includes a solid foundation in mathematics and sciences along with a broad range of courses in engineering topics.  The program culminates in engineering design courses in which students explore solutions to recognized needs as a member of a team, since so much of modern engineering is a team effort.  Engineering courses places emphasis on communication, both written and spoken enabling graduates to effectively communicate their ideas to both technical and non-technical audiences.  Because the computer is such an essential tool for analysis, the courses integrate computer methods of problem-solving.  Additionally, the School of Engineering concentrates on developing outstanding laboratory and design competencies; all students experience interdisciplinary team work at the senior level.  The school achieves very high levels of faculty-student interaction throughout its curriculum.  Other schools at Mercer University include medicine, law, pharmacy, theology, liberal arts, education, business, and nursing.  The Mercer Bachelor of Science in Engineering (BSE) program is accredited by the Engineering Accrediation Commission of ABET, Inc.  The Bachelor of Science degree in Industrial Management is accredited by the Applied Science Accrediation Commission of ABET, Inc.

Combining talents from all across UMR's rich curricula, students work together in order to compete on an international level against other top engineering schools. Beyond engineering, students learn management and leadership skills that will distinguish them upon graduation. Focusing on a specific multidisciplinary design gives the student a meaningful example of how to apply design principles. The experience of working on a student design team will prove intellectually stimulating, teach self-motivation, forge a sense of team pride, reveal the principles and worth of team-based leadership and instill in each participant the makings of a professional identity. The eight (8) design teams within the USDCC include: Advanced Aero Vehicle Group, Concrete Canoe Team, Formula SAE Racing Team, Human Powered Vehicle Team, Robotics Competition Team, Solar Car Team, Solar House Team, and Steel Bridge Team.

MSU College of Engineering offers a \"small school\" atmosphere combined with \"large-school\" opportunities, all in a vibrant small city located in one of the country's most outstanding areas of natural beauty. The College of Engineering partners with the Center for Biofilm Engineering, the Western Transportation Institute and the Montana Manufacturing Extension Center in support of its mission and goals. These research and extension centers are housed within the College and provide unique opportunities for faculty and students, as well as partnerships with government agencies and industry. The Center for Biofilm Engineering (CBE) is a National Science Foundation (NSF) Engineering Research Center, and is considered to be the world's leading center of research in the control of bacterial biofilms in natural and industrial ecosystems, and in chronic human infections. As the MSU focal point for transportation research, the Western Transportation Institute (WTI) focuses on \"making rural transportation safer, more efficient and more convenient across all modes of transportation through research, education, and technology transfer.\" Montana Manufacturing Extension Center (MMEC) is an outreach/technical center that utilizes consulting engineers in satellite offices throughout Montana to provide management and engineering services to manufacturers statewide. A primary focus is training Montana manufacturers in the latest manufacturing and engineering techniques. College of Engineering Shops Division: Organized into three distinct areas, the mission of the COE Shops is to provide direct design, modification, fabrication, and repair support to the College's educational and research needs. The Technical Services component of the Shops Division focuses on research activities primarily, but also works on educational activities as needed. The Engineering Senior Capstone Management/Assistance component is focused on providing direct dedicated support to the multidisciplinary undergraduate senior design groups (including actual fabrication of design prototypes). The COE Student/Staff/Faculty Shop is a \"self-service\" type of general purpose shop facility that provides technical assistance and supervision to students, staff, and faculty wishing to accomplish some or all of their specific shop needs themselves. The undergraduate engineering programs (Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Industrial Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering) are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology. The Computing Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology has accredited the Computer Science program. Students enrolled in College of Engineering programs may opt to study other specialty topics and participate in faculty research. The University and College strive to be a national leader as a Research Intensive University focusing on undergraduate education. Approximately five percent of undergraduates currently participate in funded research activities each year. During the senior year COE students culminate their educational experience by participating in capstone design projects, some of which are multidisciplinary. The College maintains pride in our graduates who consistently pass the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) Exam at a 92%+ rate (all engineering and Mechanical Engineering Technology graduates are required to take the FE Exam). In 2003, nine public colleges and universities in nine western states received William and Flora Hewlett Foundation grants to fund programs to improve the quality of undergraduate education in engineering and to increase the number of engineering graduates. At that time Montana State University's College of Engineering was selected as a Hewlett Foundation Engineering School of the West. These Engineering Schools of the West Initiative grants support programs to increase retention and recruitment efforts, and to improve student learning through better undergraduate teaching. The institutions, selected for a commitment to rigorous assessment and ability to sustain long-term outcomes, collaborate to tackle such issues as new ways to assess student learning or how to provide students with a global orientation to engineering problems. Schools were chosen in part because their programs had the potential of providing a significant \"multiplier effect\" leading to a change in the institution that would also be instructive to other colleges and universities. The Hewlett Designing Our Community Program (DOC) at Montana State University seeks to establish the College of Engineering as the premier choice for Native American students. Its first goal is to increase the motivation and pre-entry academic preparation of Native American students through recruitment activities on all seven Native American reservations in the state, visits to schools on the reservations, sponsorship of up to ten students to work on campus in engineering research and to enhance academic preparation in math in the Minority Apprenticeship Program (MAP) during the Summer. Goal number two is to help shape the engineering/engineering technology and computer science workforce by increasing the number of Native American students graduating from the College of Engineering. As a start on this effort, several focus groups took place with current students in engineering to garner feedback, assess needs and begin planning of the retention programs. Each semester there is a seminar course for Native Americans in Engineering. It serves as an academic enhancement with a learning community environment. The final goal of the DOC program is to improve access to quality engineering and technology to rural and underserved populations by returning highly educated professionals to these communities. A number of programs are underway in this regard. For more information please see: http://www.montana.edu/doc.

To this end, students enjoy a close relationship with full-time faculty who are licensed professionals with many years of practical experience.  While course offerings of the Civil Engineering and Geomatics Department promote education in the relevant theory common to all branches of civil engineering, engineering design concepts are emphasized and integrated throughout the curriculum.  This integration is accomplished in a sequential manner.  Early in the curriculum, elements of the creative design process are introduced as students complete simple design projects appropriate to the freshman level.  While most freshman and sophomore courses are intended to provide a solid background in mathematics, communications, the basic sciences, and the engineering sciences, certain courses provide additional concepts and methodologies supporting more advanced civil engineering design.  In junior civil engineering courses, students address practical problems of increasing complexity.  Junior courses include topics in structural engineering, hydraulics and hydrology, soil mechanics and foundations, transportation, construction management, and environmental engineering.  The Institute provides an environment where students from large and small cities, towns, and foreign countries enjoy learning together.  The Institute's ties with industry keep academic programs up to date in a rapidly-changing atmosphere.  Faculty and staff work with OIT students to meet their needs as they advance toward a rewarding career.

The various curricula also provide a broad and valuable analytical background for graduates who choose to pursue careers in fields such as business, the social sciences, medicine, and law, or who wish to continue their education in graduate studies. The Institute strives to graduate scientists and engineers who are technically competent and creative, and who are aware of the roles of engineering and science in solving social problems. To achieve these goals, Rose-Hulman provides students the basic knowledge and fundamental principles on which science and engineering are based. Students are encouraged to be critical thinkers who are innovative in their approaches to problem solving. In addition, they are introduced to social and philosophical issues with which they must be concerned, both personally and professionally. Of the many qualities which distinguish Rose-Hulman and make fulfillment of its educational purposes possible, three seem most important.  First, Rose-Hulman maintains high admissions standards so that every student who is admitted should be able to complete the baccalaureate program.  A second, closely related, quality is that Rose-Hulman has remained a small, primarily undergraduate, institution by choice.  Finally, every effort is made to recruit and encourage professors who believe that teaching is their primary responsibility.  Although Rose-Hulman professors maintain their professional competence through such activities as continuing education, consulting, research, and writing, a \"publish or perish\" atmosphere is out of place on the Rose-Hulman campus.

The undergraduate programs in Electrical and Telecommunications Engineering are accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET).  The school is a member of both the Texas Telecommunications Engineering Consortium (TxTEC) and the Global Wireless Education Consortium (GWEC). Located within a five-mile radius of the Erik Jonsson campus are more than 600 high-tech companies specializing in areas of microelectronics, telecommunications, signal processing and optics.  This strong local concentration of high-tech industry allows students to work part-time as well as to co-op in classical alternating-semester fashion or to intern during the summer months.  Up to 70 percent of the school's students hold co-op positions or internships with local industry sometime before graduation. The Erik Jonsson School has maintained close ties over the years with TI, Alcatel (the school is one of five worldwide partners in Alcatel's Research Partners program), Nortel, Ericsson, Nokia, Lucent, Lockheed Martin, Intervoice and many others.  Industry leaders have joined with the school to conduct research, share resources, enhance educational opportunities and develop new technologies.  In collaboration with these industries, several research centers of excellence have been established.  These include the Human Language Technology Center, the Center for Integrated Circuits and Systems (CICS), the Center for Systems, Communications and Signal Processing (CSCSP), the Cyber Security and Emergency Preparedness Institute, the Embedded Software Center (ESC), the Photonic Technology and Engineering Center (PhoTEC) and the Center for Advanced Telecommunications Systems and Services (CATSS).Most recently, the Jonsson School and UTD have become poised for an era of unprecedented growth and excellence in education and research, based in large part on a $300-million initiative involving TI, the State of Texas and the University of Texas System.  The five-year plan, announced in June 2003, includes the construction of a 192,000-square-foot Natural Science and Engineering Research Center at UTD, to be completed in 2006.  The new facility will serve not only to broaden the scope of current engineering research, but also to foster new interdisciplinary programs with faculty in related sciences such as physics, chemistry and molecular biology, as well as in the arts and humanities.For more information on the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science, please visit the school website: http://www.utdallas.edu/dept/eecs/ .Landmark events in the history of UTD and the Erik Jonsson School include:\u2022\tIn 1969, three of the founders of Texas Instruments offered their private research and development institution to the State of Texas to become part of the University of Texas System.  One of those men was Erik Jonsson, who later became mayor of Dallas.\u2022\tIn 1986, the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board authorized UTD's Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science to prepare students to tackle the rapidly changing world of technology and communications.\u2022\tIn 1987, UTD dedicated the Multipurpose/Start-up building, the first home of the Erik Jonsson School.\u2022\tAlso in 1987, the Regents of the University of Texas System established the Lars Magnus Ericsson Chair in Electrical Engineering.\u2022\tIn 1989, the Erik Jonsson School granted its first engineering degree. \u2022\tIn 1992, UTD dedicated a $12 million state-of-the-art Engineering and Computer Science building.  \u2022\tIn 1998, UTD researchers developed the Matrix Repository System (MRS), a highly secure system for storing proprietary telecommunications industry matrix data, for the Quality Excellence for Suppliers of Telecommunications (QuEST) forum.\u2022\tIn 1999, UTD's collaborative online program with the University of Texas at Arlington began providing graduate-level education for telecommunication professionals. \u2022\tIn August 2002, a new 152,000-square-foot engineering building opened its doors.  The new facility, constructed with a combination of state and private funding, doubled the Jonsson School's physical size to more than 300,000 square feet, including 10 new classrooms equipped with state-of-the-art audiovisual facilities. \u2022\tIn November 2002, UTD initiated three new Ph.D programs: Telecommunications Engineering, Computer Engineering and Software Engineering.  The Telecommunications Engineering doctoral degree is the first of its kind in North America, and the Software Engineering doctoral degree is the first in Texas.\u2022\tIn 2003, Kiplinger's Personal Finance rated UTD the 34th \"best value\" among public universities in the in the United States. \u2022\tIn May 2003, Dr. Robert Helms, president and CEO of International SEMATECH and Professor Emeritus at Stanford University, was named dean of the Erik Jonsson School and Lars Magnus Ericsson Professor of Electrical Engineering.\u2022\tIn June 2003, a major joint initiative among the State of Texas, the University of Texas System and Texas Instruments was announced.  The plan, officially called the Jonsson School Research Enterprise Initiative, would bring UTD an infusion of up to $300 million in state and private funding for education and research at UTD over a five-year period.  This unprecedented milestone marked the start of a new era of growth and excellence for the Erik Jonsson School and UTD.  Plans announced included construction of a new $85-million research facility, development of new academic engineering programs, interdisciplinary research activities with other schools and departments and broadened collaboration with industry and other universities and research institutes.\u2022\tIn January 2004, design began on the new Natural Science and Engineering Research Center, a 192,000-square-foot facility that will house world-class laboratories and support facilities for experimental research in electrical engineering, materials science, behavioral and brain sciences, chemistry, biology and physics.  Completion is expected in July 2006.\u2022\tIn March 2004, the Jonsson School Research Enterprise Initiative officially commenced with the signing of a formal agreement by all parties involved, followed by receipt of the first $21.5 million in funding.\u2022\tBy Fall 2004, formal degree proposals were prepared in the areas of Materials Science and Engineering (Ph.D. and M.S.) and in Computer Engineering (B.S.).  Efforts to initiate a Department of Biological Engineering were also under way.\u2022\tOn Nov. 18, 2004, a \"virtual\" groundbreaking ceremony was held on the UTD campus to celebrate the simultaneous start of construction of both the UTD Natural Science and Engineering Research Center and Texas Instruments' $3-billion semiconductor manufacturing facility in Richardson, Texas, three miles from campus.

Today, the College remains committed to a combined and balanced mission of  teaching and research--a solid under graduate program where bright students learn to apply fundamental science to real-world problems and interact with gifted faculty who are involved in innovative, internationally recognized research. The College is best known for its advanced work in computer sicence, robotics and bioengineering. Although organized into distinct departments, the academic core of the College is an active, collaborative environment where exchanges occur across disciplines and across the campus. Within our modern engineering culture, the highly interdisciplinary team approach includes activity in artificial vision, computer graphics, scientific visualization, advanced engineering design and manufacturing, biopolymers, advanced combustion technology and more. An example of our successful interaction is the the Health Sciences Center. The yield, a broad spectrum of engineering inventions: the artificial wearable kidney, Utah Arm, Interaid artificial hearing, all-electric artificial arm and hand, Utah dexterous hand, bioensors to measure body chemicals and artificial blood vessels.Faculty at the College of Engineering are leaders in research productivity. Average research support per faculty has increased 59% since 1992. The latest Science Watch citation index ranked the impact of engineering research at the U fourth highest in the nation.

The graduate programs are broad in scope and interdisciplinary and provide students flexibility in structuring a program of study.", "freshmen_enroll_table": "none", "sophomore_enroll_table": "none", "junior_enroll_table": "none", "senior_enroll_table": "none", "teaching_tenure_table": [["Engineering Department(s)", "Hisp", "Am Ind", "Asian", "B/AfrA", "Haw", "White", "Oth", "Total Personnel"], ["M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F"], ["Biomedical, Industrial & Human Factors Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "2", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "4", "1", "0", "0", "6", "1"], ["College of Engineering and Computer Science", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "1", "0", "0", "0", "1", "0"], ["Computer Science and Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "2", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "5", "0", "0", "0", "7", "0"], ["Electrical Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "5", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "1", "0", "0", "0", "6", "0"], ["Mechanical and Materials Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "2", "1", "0", "0", "0", "0", "2", "0", "0", "0", "4", "1"], ["Totals:", "0", "0", "0", "0", "11", "1", "0", "0", "0", "0", "13", "1", "0", "0", "24", "2"]], "tuition": ["6477", "12492"], "sat_scores": [["SAT", "75th", "25th"], ["Math Range:", "", ""], ["Reading Range:", "", ""], ["Combined Range:", "1075", ""], ["Note: The 1,092 number is the median score for the combined SAT range"]], "act_scores": [["ACT", "75th", "25th"], ["Math Range:", "24", ""], ["Note: The 24 number is the median score for the ACT Math range"], ["Composite Range:", "22", ""], ["Note: The 23 number is the median score for the ACT Composite range"]], "degree_table": "none"}, {"name": "University of Wyoming", "type": "PUBLIC", "undergrad_enroll": "9517", "graduate_enroll": "2290", "description": "Co-op programs and undergraduate research opportunities are available but not required.", "freshmen_enroll_table": "none", "sophomore_enroll_table": "none", "junior_enroll_table": "none", "senior_enroll_table": "none", "teaching_tenure_table": [["Engineering Department(s)", "Hisp", "Am Ind", "Asian", "B/AfrA", "Haw", "White", "Oth", "Total Personnel"], ["M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F"], ["Atmospheric Science", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "6", "0", "0", "0", "6", "0"], ["Chemical and Petroleum Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "1", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "4", "0", "0", "0", "5", "0"], ["Civil and Architectural Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "2", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "5", "0", "0", "0", "7", "0"], ["Computer Science", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "3", "0", "0", "0", "3", "0"], ["Electrical and Computer Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "1", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "4", "0", "0", "0", "5", "0"], ["Engineering Dean's Office", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "2", "0", "0", "0", "2", "0"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "7", "0", "0", "0", "7", "0"], ["Totals:", "0", "0", "0", "0", "4", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "31", "0", "0", "0", "35", "0"]], "tuition": ["3243", "9273"], "sat_scores": [["SAT", "75th", "25th"], ["Math Range:", "780", "400"], ["Reading Range:", "730", "360"], ["Combined Range:", "1430", "800"]], "act_scores": [["ACT", "75th", "25th"], ["Math Range:", "36", "15"], ["Composite Range:", "33", "16"]], "degree_table": "none"}, {"name": "Yale School of Engineering & Applied Science", "type": "PRIVATE", "undergrad_enroll": "5262", "graduate_enroll": "2560", "description": "An engineering education at Yale prepares a student for pursuing a career in engineering, for successful graduate study resulting in a Ph.D., for management of high tech enterprises, and for civic leadership. Yale's demanding engineering education is significantly enhanced by courses in the humanities, social sciences, the arts, and foreign languages, which engineering majors take alongside humanities majors. The resulting broad education enables an impressive number of Yale Engineering graduates to be successful in their careers and to assume positions of leadership in many segments of society.The Yale Faculty of Engineering offers majors in Biomedical, Chemical, Electrical, Environmental, Mechanical Engineering, and Applied Physics. Each major provides many options. Engineering students may also pursue engineering-related majors in Electrical Engineering/Computer Science, Computer Science, and Applied Mathematics. A number of students choose to graduate with a double major, for example, Engineering and Music/Economics/Psychology.Students who have their sights set on leadership positions in industry enroll in the Select Program in Engineering and graduate in five years with a Master of Engineering degree as well as hands-on industrial experience, acquired during two summer internships in industry.At Yale, it is faculty, not graduate students, who teach undergraduates. The faculty-to-senior ratio is approximately one to one, and students enjoy much individual guidance. Faculty not only supervise student projects but also involve them in their own research. Faculty acknowledge their student researchers in published research papers, which means that some students graduate with their name on scientific publications. Engineering has a 150-year history at Yale (1852-2002). The first Engineering Ph.D. in the U.S. was awarded at Yale, in 1863. The recipient was J. Willard Gibbs who went on to become a leading scientist of the nineteenth century.", "freshmen_enroll_table": "none", "sophomore_enroll_table": "none", "junior_enroll_table": "none", "senior_enroll_table": "none", "teaching_tenure_table": [["Engineering Department(s)", "Hisp", "Am Ind", "Asian", "B/AfrA", "Haw", "White", "Oth", "Total Personnel"], ["M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F"], ["Applied Physics", "0", "0", "0", "0", "1", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "9", "0", "0", "0", "10", "0"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "1", "0", "0", "0", "1", "0"], ["Chemical Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "8", "1", "0", "0", "8", "1"], ["Electrical Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "2", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "5", "0", "0", "0", "7", "0"], ["Engineering and Applied Science", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "4", "0", "0", "0", "4", "0"], ["Totals:", "0", "0", "0", "0", "3", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "27", "1", "0", "0", "30", "1"]], "tuition": ["29820"], "sat_scores": "none", "act_scores": "none", "degree_table": "none"}, {"name": "York College of Pennsylvania", "type": "PRIVATE", "undergrad_enroll": "5379", "graduate_enroll": "308", "description": "Teaching, Tenure-Track\n\t \n\t\tView Gender/Ethnicity Profiles\n", "freshmen_enroll_table": "none", "sophomore_enroll_table": "none", "junior_enroll_table": "none", "senior_enroll_table": "none", "teaching_tenure_table": [["Engineering Department(s)", "Hisp", "Am Ind", "Asian", "B/AfrA", "Haw", "White", "Oth", "Total Personnel"], ["M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "1", "0", "0", "0", "1", "0"], ["Totals:", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "1", "0", "0", "0", "1", "0"]], "tuition": ["9476"], "sat_scores": [["SAT", "75th", "25th"], ["Math Range:", "510", "605"], ["Reading Range:", "580", "660"], ["Combined Range:", "", ""]], "act_scores": [["ACT", "75th", "25th"], ["Math Range:", "", ""], ["Composite Range:", "", ""]], "degree_table": "none"}]
