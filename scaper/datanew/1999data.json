The undergraduate program is within Harvard College, Fauclty of Arts and Sciences.  It is an opportunity to earn an engineering degree within a liberal arts atmosphere.  At most colleges and universities, undergraduates must enroll in programs in one branch of engineering or another.  At Harvard, students can take such a curriculum, but can also design and pursue an individualized program that cuts across the conventional branches and prepares students for other careers and activities.Some students arrange curricula with a strong emphasis on electrical or mechanical engineering and take industrial positions as soon as they graduate.  Others design and complete broader programs well suited for bioengineering, computing and communications, or manufacturing, or, more generally, for medicine, law, business, public service or entrepreneurship.  A substantial number go on to graduate school.Graduate education in the Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences is designed primairly for students who intend to develop skills in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and the engineering sciences and apply these disciplines to problems directly related to human needs.

Our Vision: Students of  all ages and cultures, regardless of their major areas of interest, will find the knowledge, critical thinking skills, learning tools, and understanding of technology they acquire from the Tufts College of Engineering to be invaluable in the twenty first century.At the College of Engineering we are genuinely excited about the insights learners gain from their exposure to the profession of engineering and to the critical components that constitute a Tufts engineering education.  Through a wide variety of degree and study options, the College provides opportunities and quality educational experiences for a diverse population interested in life-long learning.  We endeavor to make our College an ever more inviting place for students preparing for professional engineering careers; students who will build such non-engineering careers as architecture, business, international relations, law, and medicine; students from underrepresented groups, including women, who are considering technical careers; and practicing engineering professionals who want to stay current in developing fields.  We view engineering education as liberal or, more precisely, liberating since our graduates have so few limits on their career paths.We strive to have faculty members recognized as leaders in engineering education, research, and practice; to maintain technical breadth and to be recognized for specific areas of technical excellence; and to foster an atmosphere supportive of learning.  We envision a college that leads in linking the continuum of education - from pre-school to secondary school and throughout the undergraduate and graduate experience, as well as to continuing-education opportunities focused on the individual.  At Tufts, the College sees itself as the catalyst and center of technical and applied science education for the entire University as well as a bridge to industry.  Intrinsic to this vision, our College is a community of learners, which encourages and provides opportunities for students to develop programs of study customized to their professional and intellectual goals.  Our outstanding undergraduate research activities and expanded internship program offer our students exciting opportunities for cutting-edge inquiry and professional experience.  As a major component of a student-centered university, we ensure that students in the College of Engineering take advantage of our close ties with the College of Liberal Arts and Jackson and the diverse extracurricular opportunities on campus, to prepare for an increasingly complex global society and international professional environment. Our Missioin - The College of Engineering is committed to the mission of offering undergraduate, graduate, and continuing-education students a rigorous and professionally grounded education that provides the knowledge and skills they will need in order to grow as professionals and critically involved members of society.  The College of Engineering is dedicated both to pursuing discipline-based professional education and research, and to exploring critical areas at the interfaces between disciplines.  This commitment is embodied in our activities which generate, disseminate, and advance knowledge within the ever-changing international, multicultural, and technological context of today's world.  Our focus on collaborative teaching and research within the College of Engineering and with the College of Liberal Arts and Jackson and the Tufts professional schools provides unusual academic richness.  The College of Engineering takes advantage of its close relationship with the College of Liberal Arts and Jackson to create special opportunities for teaching and research.  These offer to engineering students a strong liberal-arts background, and to liberal arts students an understanding and appreciation of aspects of engineering and technology.  We develop awareness among students that engineers through their technological work are agents of social change, so that our graduates will be sensitive to the effects their work may have on the environment and society.The College of Engineering strives to create a climate within and beyond the classroom in which faculty and staff can share with students the excitement of intellectual discovery and freely exchange ideas.  We are dedicated to enhancing this climate through small classes, individual and group student research, internships, and design projects, often defined and executed with industrial collaborators.  The College of Engineering seeks to establish and strengthen strategic partnerships with industry to the mutual benefit of both.  These alliances have the potential to provide the College with a broader knowledge of the use of engineering today, enhance our vision of future technological trends, and provide career opportunities for our students while highlighting education options for our industry partners.
