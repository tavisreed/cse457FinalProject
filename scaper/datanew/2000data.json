The Institute strives to graduate scientists and engineers who are technically competent and creative, and who are aware of the roles of engineering and science in solving social problems. To achieve these goals, Rose-Hulman provides students the basic knowledge and fundamental principles on which science and engineering are based. Students are encouraged to be critical thinkers who are innovative in their approaches to problem solving. In addition, they are introduced to social and philosophical issues with which they must be concerned, both personally and professionally. Of the many qualities which distinguish Rose-Hulman and make fulfillment of its educational purposes possible, three seem most important.  First, Rose-Hulman maintains high admissions standards so that every student who is admitted should be able to complete the baccalaureate program.  A second, closely related, quality is that Rose-Hulman has remained a small, primarily undergraduate, institution by choice.  Finally, every effort is made to recruit and encourage professors who believe that teaching is their primary responsibility.  Although Rose-Hulman professors maintain their professional competence through such activities as continuing education, consulting, research, and writing, a \"publish or perish\" atmosphere is out of place on the Rose-Hulman campus.

Today, TrinityCollege is one of just a handful of highly-selective liberal arts colleges that offers ABET-accredited engineering degree programs.  The mission of the Trinity College Engineering Department is to educate and inspire engineering students within the liberal arts environmentso that they will possess the knowledge and vision to make significant contributions to the engineering profession and to society at large.Trinity engineers have been successfully employed by a wide range of high-tech corporations and research laboratories, including United Technologies, Pratt and Whitney, Otis, Hamilton-Standard, Sikorsky, Carrier, Digital Equipment Corporation, Naval Research Laboratories, IBM Watson Research Center, Army Research Laboratories, AT&T; BellLabs, Teledyne Brown, Pacific Communications Services, Andersen Consulting, CIGNA, National Instruments, Massachusetts General Hospital, Chemical Bank, and NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab, among many others. Trinity students have also studied at some of the top engineering graduate programs, including M.I.T., R.P.I., Stanford, Duke, Yale, Brown, Cornell, Marquette, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Tulane.

Our Vision: Students of  all ages and cultures, regardless of their major areas of interest, will find the knowledge, critical thinking skills, learning tools, and understanding of technology they acquire from the Tufts College of Engineering to be invaluable in the twenty first century.At the College of Engineering we are genuinely excited about the insights learners gain from their exposure to the profession of engineering and to the critical components that constitute a Tufts engineering education.  Through a wide variety of degree and study options, the College provides opportunities and quality educational experiences for a diverse population interested in life-long learning.  We endeavor to make our College an ever more inviting place for students preparing for professional engineering careers; students who will build such non-engineering careers as architecture, business, international relations, law, and medicine; students from underrepresented groups, including women, who are considering technical careers; and practicing engineering professionals who want to stay current in developing fields.  We view engineering education as liberal or, more precisely, liberating since our graduates have so few limits on their career paths.We strive to have faculty members recognized as leaders in engineering education, research, and practice; to maintain technical breadth and to be recognized for specific areas of technical excellence; and to foster an atmosphere supportive of learning.  We envision a college that leads in linking the continuum of education - from pre-school to secondary school and throughout the undergraduate and graduate experience, as well as to continuing-education opportunities focused on the individual.  At Tufts, the College sees itself as the catalyst and center of technical and applied science education for the entire University as well as a bridge to industry.  Intrinsic to this vision, our College is a community of learners, which encourages and provides opportunities for students to develop programs of study customized to their professional and intellectual goals.  Our outstanding undergraduate research activities and expanded internship program offer our students exciting opportunities for cutting-edge inquiry and professional experience.  As a major component of a student-centered university, we ensure that students in the College of Engineering take advantage of our close ties with the College of Liberal Arts and Jackson and the diverse extracurricular opportunities on campus, to prepare for an increasingly complex global society and international professional environment. Our Missioin - The College of Engineering is committed to the mission of offering undergraduate, graduate, and continuing-education students a rigorous and professionally grounded education that provides the knowledge and skills they will need in order to grow as professionals and critically involved members of society.  The College of Engineering is dedicated both to pursuing discipline-based professional education and research, and to exploring critical areas at the interfaces between disciplines.  This commitment is embodied in our activities which generate, disseminate, and advance knowledge within the ever-changing international, multicultural, and technological context of today's world.  Our focus on collaborative teaching and research within the College of Engineering and with the College of Liberal Arts and Jackson and the Tufts professional schools provides unusual academic richness.  The College of Engineering takes advantage of its close relationship with the College of Liberal Arts and Jackson to create special opportunities for teaching and research.  These offer to engineering students a strong liberal-arts background, and to liberal arts students an understanding and appreciation of aspects of engineering and technology.  We develop awareness among students that engineers through their technological work are agents of social change, so that our graduates will be sensitive to the effects their work may have on the environment and society.The College of Engineering strives to create a climate within and beyond the classroom in which faculty and staff can share with students the excitement of intellectual discovery and freely exchange ideas.  We are dedicated to enhancing this climate through small classes, individual and group student research, internships, and design projects, often defined and executed with industrial collaborators.  The College of Engineering seeks to establish and strengthen strategic partnerships with industry to the mutual benefit of both.  These alliances have the potential to provide the College with a broader knowledge of the use of engineering today, enhance our vision of future technological trends, and provide career opportunities for our students while highlighting education options for our industry partners.
