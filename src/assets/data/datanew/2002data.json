The department's programs are designed to help satisfy the engineering manpower needs of industry in Arkansas and the mid-South region.  The objectives of the programs are to produce graduates with a professional attitude and approach to problem solving, well educated in the basics of engineering with a strong cross-disciplinary component and emphasis on engineering design.

The Management of Technology (MOT) Certificate Program (a joint program with the Haas School of Business and the Meakin Interdisciplinary Studies Program) is designed to teach business personnel and engineers the basics of technology management, and offers courses in manufacturing, marketing, research and development strategies, and intellectual property rights.  * MOT is not a degree granting program. 5. Graduate program in Bioengineering is jointly offered by UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco.  The Bioengineering department will join with the planned UCSF Bioengineering department (now a Division in the School of Medicine).  The department will be the first joint department between two campuses in the UC System.  The connection with UCSF will provide strong clinically-oriented and applied sciences resources for the bioengineering program.  This program already exists at the graduate level (PhD).  The Joint UCSF/UCB Bioengineering Graduate Group, which has flourished over the last 14 years, provides this level of connection at the graduate level with students being trained and receiving degrees from both institutions.6. The Committee on Engineering Science administers the Engineering Science undergraduate degree programs (Computational Engineering Science, Engineering Math and Statistics, Environmental Engineering Science, and Engineering Physics).  Admission to a two-year non-degree program (Engineering-Undeclared) is available.  7.  Civil and Environmental Engineering and Industrial Engineering and Operations Research jointly offer an interdisciplinary program, Logistics Certificate Program, for graduate students.  8.  The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering offers a minor in structural engineering, designed particularly for students in the Department of Architecture, but also available to any student who has met the prerequisites and is enrolled in a non-civil engineering program.  9.  Concurrent graduate degree programs are offered between Civil and Environmental Engineering (M.S.) and City and Regional Planning (M.C.P.), Civil Eng. (M.S.) and Architecture (M. Arch.), and Civil Eng. (M.S.) and Public Policy (M.P.P.).10. The Department of Mechanical Engineering offers two joint undergraduate programs; one with the Department of Nuclear Engineering and one with the Department of Materials Science and Engineering.11. The Department of Materials Science and Engineering offers joint undergraduate programs with Chemical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, Nuclear Engineering and Mechanical Engineering.12. The Department of Nuclear Engineering offers joint programs with Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, Materials Science and Engineering, Chemical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering.", "freshmen_enroll_table": "none", "sophomore_enroll_table": "none", "junior_enroll_table": "none", "senior_enroll_table": "none", "teaching_tenure_table": [["Engineering Department(s)", "Hisp", "Am Ind", "Asian", "B/AfrA", "Haw", "White", "Oth", "Total Personnel"], ["M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F"], ["Bioengineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0"], ["Chemical Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "2", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "12", "1", "0", "1", "14", "2"], ["Civil and Environmental Engineering", "2", "1", "0", "0", "1", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "29", "1", "0", "0", "32", "2"], ["Double Major", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0"], ["Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences", "1", "0", "0", "0", "10", "1", "0", "0", "0", "0", "46", "3", "0", "0", "57", "4"], ["Industrial Engineering and Operations Research", "0", "0", "0", "0", "1", "1", "0", "0", "0", "0", "6", "1", "0", "0", "7", "2"], ["Materials Science and Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "2", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "10", "1", "0", "0", "12", "1"], ["Meakin Interdisciplinary Studies Center", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "2", "0", "0", "0", "8", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "25", "2", "0", "0", "35", "2"], ["Nuclear Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "5", "0", "0", "0", "5", "0"], ["Totals:", "5", "1", "0", "0", "24", "2", "0", "0", "0", "0", "133", "9", "0", "1", "162", "13"]], "tuition": ["4201", "16580"], "sat_scores": [["SAT", "75th", "25th"], ["Math Range:", "", ""], ["Reading Range:", "", ""], ["Combined Range:", "", ""]], "act_scores": [["ACT", "75th", "25th"], ["Math Range:", "", ""], ["Composite Range:", "", ""]], "degree_table": "none"}, {"name": "University of California, Davis", "type": "PUBLIC", "undergrad_enroll": "22750", "graduate_enroll": "3554", "description": "The College of Engineering offers undergraduate programs in eight academic departments and graduate programs in six academic departments and three interdisciplinary graduate groups.

Some students arrange curricula with a strong emphasis on electrical or mechanical engineering and take industrial positions as soon as they graduate.  Others design and complete broader programs well suited for bioengineering, computing and communications, or manufacturing, or, more generally, for medicine, law, business, public service or entrepreneurship.  A substantial number go on to graduate school.  Students studying Computer Science at Harvard College study basic mathematics, theoretical foundations of computer science, systems, and a selection of technical electives.  Faculty offer an array of courses in software, hardware, and theory.  Students can appy the foundations of computer science to various technical fields - economics, electrical engineering, linguistics, and mathematics, as well as neuroscience and cognition-through the College's interdisciplinary Mind, Brain, and Behavior Program.  Graduate students in Engineering Sciences and Computer Science engage in active exploration of a wide range of areas.

While other universities offer certificate programs or minor programs related to biobased products and bioenergy, ISU offers M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in this new field as well as a minor for students obtaining degrees in other majors.  The program offers students with a wide variety of science and engineering backgrounds advanced study in the use of plant- and crop-based resources for the production of biobased products, including fuels, chemicals, materials, and energy.2)  The Virtual Reality Applications Center (VRAC) uses the C6 and C4 virtual environment facilities to conduct research in science and engineering applications of virtual reality.  The Center is part of the Institute for Physical Research and Technology, a network of research and outreach centers at Iowa State University.  Over thirty faculty members from sixteen departments and four colleges provide leadership for research involving 70 graduate and 60 undergraduate students.  VRAC recently opened a new flexible, \"immersive projection\" system that can create a viewing area as large as 36 feet wide and 10 feet tall, equal to the area of over 400 standard 17-inch computer monitors.  This new facility, called C4, can also be made into a 12-by-12 foot room with images projected onto three walls as well as the floor.  VRAC also hosts the C6, one of the world's leading VR facilities, with six-sided projection and wireless interaction devices.  A nearby auditorium is also equipped with 3D projection and display capabilities, enabling large audiences to interact with virtual worlds.  3)  Iowa State University now offers Graduate certificates in Information Assurance and Power Systems Engineering to on- and off-campus students.  Graduate certificates provide students the opportunity to pursue prescribed and focus areas of study at the graduate level and earn a graduate credential from ISU's Graduate College.  Typical graduate certificates include 9 to 12 credit hours of graduate work and may be completed in as little as one academic year.  Students who pursue graduate certificates complete graduate courses that may also be applied towards master's degree programs of study.  4)  Iowa State University offers off-campus credit courses leading to the bachelor's degree in electrical engineering at multiple sites within Iowa and to the master's degree in electrical engineering, computer engineering, mechanical engineering, and systems engineering at multiple sites across the nation.5)  Iowa State University has been designated as one of the charter seven Centers of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education by the National Security Agency.  A new multidisciplinary master's of science program addresses technical and non-technical areas of the Information Assurance field.  Faculty members in six departments offer a set of interconnected courses that provide a firm grounding in Information Assurance, preparing students to embark on careers in Information Technology which focuses on protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.6)  To increase the interest in graduate study at Iowa State University's Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, or Materials Science and Engineering departments, the concurrent BS/MS program allows undergraduate students the opportunity to sample graduate coursework and research.7)  Iowa State University's College of Engineering and the University of Iowa's Henry B. Tippie School of Management now offer an Executive Dual Degree program in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, created especially for mid- to upper-level engineering managers and executives.

The purpose of Mercer University's School of Engineering is to educate a student who is preparing to be a practicing engineer, one who can responsibly contribute to a global society that is becoming ever more dependent on technology.  The engineering program of study includes a solid foundation in mathematics and sciences along with a broad range of courses in engineering topics.  The program culminates in engineering design courses in which a student explores solutions to recognize needs as a member of a team, since so much of modern engineering is a team effort.  Engineering courses places emphasis on the written and spoken word, enabling graduates to effectively communicate their ideas to both technical and non-technical audiences.  Because the computer is such an essential tool for analysis, the courses integrate computer methods of problem-solving.  While the focus of the engineering school is to educate engineers, its graduates may enter many fields of graduate study, especially those requiring the disciplined problem solving methods developed in the undergraduate engineering curriculum.  Additionally, the Mercer School of Engineering concentrates on developing outstanding laboratory and design competencies; all students experience interdisciplinary team work at the senior level.  The school achieves very high levels of faculty-student interaction throughout its curriculum.  Mercer University began as a liberal arts-humanities school in 1833.

Eleven (11) of these degree areas are in the School of Engineering and six (6) are in the School of Mines and Metallurgy.  The master of engineering degree is offered in Manufacturing Engineering. The two engineering schools cooperate very closely and have many jointly operated research projects and groups.  A special feature of research that evolved early in the development of the University of Missouri - Rolla is the high degree of interdisciplinary work that is routinely done.USDCC (University Student Design Competition Center) was established to promote excellence in multidisciplinary student design projects. Combining talents from all across UMR's rich curricula, students work together in order to compete on an international level against other top engineering schools. Beyond engineering, students learn management and loeadership skills that will distinguish them upon graduation. Focusing on a specific multidisciplinary design givers the student a meaningful example of how to apply design principles.

This integration is accomplished in a sequential manner.  Early in the curriculum, elements of the creative design process are introduced as students complete simple design projects appropriate to the freshman level.  While most freshman and sophomore courses are intended to provide a solid background in mathematics, communications, the basic sciences, and the engineering sciences, certain courses provide additional concepts and methodologies supporting more advanced civil engineering design.  In junior civil engineering courses, students address practical problems of increasing complexity.  Junior courses include topics in structural engineering, hydraulics and hydrology, soil mechanics and foundations, transportation, construction management, and environmental engineering.  The Institute provides an environment where students from large and small cities, towns, and foreign countries enjoy learning together.  The Institute's ties with industry keep academic programs up to date in a rapidly-changing atmosphere.  Faculty and staff work with OIT students to meet their needs as they advance toward a rewarding career.

Growth in demand for engineers and computer scientists is driven by global technology-based industrial growth, aging infrastructure and an expanding need for new infrastructure, and environmental stresses imposed by expanding human activities. The environment for engineering practice is increasingly more dynamic, in part due to: \u00b7\tGlobal accessibility to technology \u00b7\tGlobal networks of collaborative technical experts \u00b7\tSpeed of innovation as a basis for competition \u00b7\tIncreased complexity of products and services \u00b7\tIncreased impact of technological developments on society and the environment This dynamic environment places increasing demands on the education of new graduates and necessitates life-long learning for practicing engineers. Our vision is to meet the needs of this rapidly changing, global environment by:\u00b7\tEvolving our curriculum to a form in which learning is motivated by interdisciplinary engineering practice that is woven into our traditional engineering science curriculum. Through this process, our graduates will gain both fundamental knowledge of engineering practice and the social and communication skills that will make them among the best prepared for immediate engineering practice. \u00b7\tInitiating and growing collaborative, interdisciplinary research programs that are motivated by local, national and international needs for knowledge discovery. Simultaneously, our faculty will become international experts connected to a global collaborative network and our research and graduate studies programs will be seen as national assets. \u00b7\tCreating an environment for learning and discovery that will be attractive to many of the best and brightest students. The majority of Oregon's best high school graduates and outstanding students from the Northwest, across the nation, and around the world will select the College. \u00b7\tInitiating collaborative efforts that strengthen our engagement with local, national, and international constituencies.

Transfer credits are granted by the individual departments on the basis of course-by-course evaluation. The programs offered prepare students for careers in industry or for graduate study in specialized fields.  The programs associated with the Computer, Electrical, Industrial & Systems, Mechanical, and Microelectronic Engineering Departments in the Kate Gleason College of Engineeering at RIT are accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET).  The Software Engineering program (formerly a part of the Kate Gleason College of Engineering, but now a part of the B. Thomas Golisano College of Computing & Information Sciences at RIT) became eligible for accreditation upon the graduation of its first class in 2001.", "freshmen_enroll_table": "none", "sophomore_enroll_table": "none", "junior_enroll_table": "none", "senior_enroll_table": "none", "teaching_tenure_table": [["Engineering Department(s)", "Hisp", "Am Ind", "Asian", "B/AfrA", "Haw", "White", "Oth", "Total Personnel"], ["M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F"], ["Computer Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "2", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "1", "1", "0", "0", "3", "1"], ["Design, Development & Manufacturing", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0"], ["Electrical Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "5", "1", "0", "0", "0", "0", "3", "0", "0", "0", "8", "1"], ["Industrial & Systems Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "1", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "1", "0"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "3", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "10", "0", "0", "0", "13", "0"], ["Microelectronic Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "1", "0", "0", "0", "0", "2", "0", "0", "0", "2", "1"], ["Microsystems Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "1", "0", "0", "0", "1", "0"], ["Quality & Applied Statistics", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "1", "0", "0", "0", "1", "0"], ["Software Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "1", "0", "0", "0", "1", "0"], ["Undeclared Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0"], ["Totals:", "0", "0", "0", "0", "11", "2", "0", "0", "0", "0", "19", "1", "0", "0", "30", "3"]], "tuition": ["19815"], "sat_scores": [["SAT", "75th", "25th"], ["Math Range:", "", ""], ["Note: Range is middle 50%."], ["Reading Range:", "", ""], ["Note: Range is middle 50%."], ["Combined Range:", "1320", "1160"], ["Note: Range is middle 50%."]], "act_scores": [["ACT", "75th", "25th"], ["Math Range:", "", ""], ["Composite Range:", "29", "25"], ["Note: Range is middle 50%."]], "degree_table": "none"}, {"name": "Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology", "type": "PRIVATE", "undergrad_enroll": "1642", "graduate_enroll": "162", "description": "The fundamental purpose of the Institute is to educate students for careers in engineering and science. The various curricula also provide a broad and valuable analytical background for graduates who choose to pursue careers in fields such as business, the social sciences, medicine, and law, or who wish to continue their education in graduate studies. The Institute strives to graduate scientists and engineers who are technically competent and creative, and who are aware of the roles of engineering and science in solving social problems. To achieve these goals, Rose-Hulman provides students the basic knowledge and fundamental principles on which science and engineering are based. Students are encouraged to be critical thinkers who are innovative in their approaches to problem solving. In addition, they are introduced to social and philosophical issues with which they must be concerned, both personally and professionally. Of the many qualities which distinguish Rose-Hulman and make fulfillment of its educational purposes possible, three seem most important.  First, Rose-Hulman maintains high admissions standards so that every student who is admitted should be able to complete the baccalaureate program.  A second, closely related, quality is that Rose-Hulman has remained a small, primarily undergraduate, institution by choice.  Finally, every effort is made to recruit and encourage professors who believe that teaching is their primary responsibility.  Although Rose-Hulman professors maintain their professional competence through such activities as continuing education, consulting, research, and writing, a \"publish or perish\" atmosphere is out of place on the Rose-Hulman campus.

These are just a few benefits of a strong alliance between industry and academe.At the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) the strong tie that binds the University to corporations was present even at UTD's inception.   Some 31 years ago the founders of Texas Instruments offered their private research and development institution to the State of Texas to become part of the University of Texas System.   Seventeen years later the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board authorized UTD's Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science to prepare students to tackle the rapidly changing world of technology and communications.UTD and the Jonsson School have maintained close ties with TI, but as enrollment and programs have grown, so have the relationships with other corporations such as Alcatel (The Jonsson School has recently been named as one of 5 world wide research partners in Alcatel's Preferred Partner program), Nortel, Ericsson, Nokia, WorldCom/MCI, Lucent, and many others.  Industry leaders have joined with UTD and the Jonsson School to conduct research, share resources, enhance educational opportunities, and develop new technologies.The Jonsson School is located 9 miles north of downtown Dallas and there are 900 high-tech companies within a 5 mile radius of the campus.  This location allows our cooperative education students to work part-time and go to school full-time or co-op in classical alternating semester method.  Seventy percent (70%) of our full-time students co-op or intern with the local high-tech industry. The Jonsson School also has several 3+2 programs in the North Texas area, the most notable is with Texas Woman's University and Austin College.  The Jonsson School is a member of the Texas Telecommunications Engineering Consortium (TxTEC) with The University of Texas at Austin, Texas Tech University and Texas A&M; University. Corporate members of TxTEC are AT&T;, Fujitsu, Motorola, Nortel, Southwestern Bell and Texas Instruments. The School is also a member of the Global Wireless Education Consortium (GWEC).  Industry members of the consortium include; Ericsson, AT&T; Wireless Services, Lucent Technologies, and Motorola's Cellular Infrastructure Group.  The GWEC consortium has developed a co-op/internship program with the wireless industry.  Very recently the Jonsson School was chosen to develop and maintain the Quality Excellence for Suppliers of Telecommunications (QuEST) Forum's Metrics Repository System (MRS).  The MRS will contain world-wide performance measurements for telecommunication companies registered to TL 9000.In recent years, the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science (with the support of local industry) has established several research centers of excellence, including the Digital Forensic and Emergency Preparedness Institute, the Center for Integrated Circuits and Systems (CICS), the Center for Systems, Communications, and Signal Processing (CSCSP), the Embedded Software Center (ESC), the Photonic Technology and Engineering Center (PhoTEC), and the Center for Advanced Telecommunications Systems and Services (CATSS).Other landmark events in the history of UTD and the Jonsson School include:* In 1987, the Regents of the University of Texas System establishedthe Lars Magnus Ericsson Chair in Electrical Engineering.* In 1989, the Jonsson School granted its first engineering degree. * In 1992, UTD dedicated the Engineering and Computer Sciencebuilding (now ECS North). The state-of-the-art facility was fundedin part by a $12 million gift from the excellence in educationfoundation established by the TI founders - Erik Jonsson, CecilGreen, and Eugene McDermott. * In 1998, the Quality Excellence for Suppliers ofTelecommunications (QuEST) forum selected UTD to develop and host ahighly secure system for storing proprietary telecommunicationsindustry matrix data. The Matrix Repository System (MRS) was developed by researchers from UTD's computer science department and went into operation in January 2000. * In 1999, Kiplinger's Personal Finance rated UTD among the top 100universities in the United States, one of only three Texasuniversities to make the list. * In 1999, UTD's collaborative online program with the University ofTexas at Arlington began providing graduate level education fortelecommunication professionals. * In 1999, UTD attracted 24 national merit and achievement scholarsranking among the top 50 public universities in the nation forattracting these gifted students. In Texas, only two publicinstitutions attracted more national merit scholars. * In early 2000, the Jonsson School received approval from theUniversity of Texas Board of Regents for an additional engineeringbuilding. The new, 150,000-square-foot facility, which wasconstructed using both state and private funds, opened its doors tostudents and faculty in August 2002. The new wing has doubled theSchool's physical size to more than 300,000 square feet, including10 new classrooms equipped with state-of-the-art audiovisualfacilities. * In November 2002, the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Boardgave approval for three new Ph.D. programs in Telecommunications Engineering, Computer Engineering and Software Engineering. The Telecommunications Engineering doctoral degree is the first of its kind in North America, and the Software Engineering doctoral degree is the first in Texas.", "freshmen_enroll_table": "none", "sophomore_enroll_table": "none", "junior_enroll_table": "none", "senior_enroll_table": "none", "teaching_tenure_table": [["Engineering Department(s)", "Hisp", "Am Ind", "Asian", "B/AfrA", "Haw", "White", "Oth", "Total Personnel"], ["M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F"], ["Computer Science", "0", "0", "0", "0", "6", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "6", "0", "0", "0", "12", "0"], ["Electrical Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "4", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "13", "0", "0", "0", "17", "0"], ["Telecommunications Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "1", "0", "0", "0", "1", "0"], ["Totals:", "0", "0", "0", "0", "10", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "20", "0", "0", "0", "30", "0"]], "tuition": ["4775", "11315"], "sat_scores": [["SAT", "75th", "25th"], ["Math Range:", "700", "580"], ["Reading Range:", "650", "530"], ["Combined Range:", "1340", "1120"]], "act_scores": [["ACT", "75th", "25th"], ["Math Range:", "30", "23"], ["Composite Range:", "28", "23"]], "degree_table": "none"}, {"name": "The University of Texas at El Paso", "type": "PUBLIC", "undergrad_enroll": "14384", "graduate_enroll": "2614", "description": "The College offers four-year undergraduate programs in engineering and computer science.

The West Point environment is designed to foster development in leadership, moral courage, and integrity essential to such service.  With this overall objective in mind, the United States Military Academy has formulated and articulated five Academy Outcome Goals:  1.  Develop graduates who have a foundation of knowledge in the sciences and humanities, an understanding of various methods of inquiry, the ability to communicate clearly, creativity, intellectual curiosity, and a commitment to continuing intellectual growth.  2.  Develop graduates who have the military knowledge and skills required for commissioning in the Regular Army:  self-disciplines, selfless committment to service, and motivation to continue professional military development.3.

Some students combine Engineeringwith othe r disciplines and graduate with a double major, e.g., Engineering and Music orEconomics or Psychology.Students who have their sights set on leadership positions in industry can enroll in theSelect Program in Engineering and graduate in five years with a Master of Engineering ora Master of Science degree and hands -on experience in industry during summer intern-ships.Among the benefits of studying Engineering at Yale is high faculty-to-student ratio.Faculty not only teach undergraduate courses but supervise projects initiated by unde r-graduatesand even involve undergraduates in their own research.Another distinguishing feature of Engineering at Yale is the requirement that studentscomplement their engineering and science education with courses in the humanities, so-cialsciences, arts, and foreign languages. The resulting broad educational backgroundenables an impressive number of Yale Engineering graduates to distinguish themselvesin their field--even to pioneer new fields--as well as to assume positions of leadership onmany levels in society.*Yale was one of the very first universities in the U.S. to offer Engineering, in 1852. In 1863, it awarded thefirst U.S. doctorate in Engineering to J. Willard Gibbs who went on to become a leading scientist of the nine-teenthcentury (see Engineering at Yale, School, Department, Council: 1932 -82 by W. Jack Cunningham,Professor Emeritus of Electrical Engineering, published by the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences in1992).", "freshmen_enroll_table": "none", "sophomore_enroll_table": "none", "junior_enroll_table": "none", "senior_enroll_table": "none", "teaching_tenure_table": [["Engineering Department(s)", "Hisp", "Am Ind", "Asian", "B/AfrA", "Haw", "White", "Oth", "Total Personnel"], ["M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F"], ["Applied Physics", "0", "0", "0", "0", "5", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "11", "0", "0", "0", "16", "0"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0"], ["Chemical Engineering", "1", "0", "0", "0", "2", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "12", "4", "0", "0", "15", "4"], ["Electrical Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "5", "2", "0", "0", "0", "0", "15", "2", "0", "0", "20", "4"], ["Environmental Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "1", "0", "0", "0", "7", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "10", "3", "0", "0", "18", "3"], ["Totals:", "2", "0", "0", "0", "19", "2", "0", "0", "0", "0", "48", "9", "0", "0", "69", "11"]], "tuition": ["27130"], "sat_scores": "none", "act_scores": "none", "degree_table": "none"}]
