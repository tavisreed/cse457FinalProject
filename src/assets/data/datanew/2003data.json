Partnerships with the local industry and other BSU supporters resulted in funding for 2 new facilities; a four-story engineering building, and a high-bay civil engineering building.  These new facilities were completed in fall 1999, and house extensive offices, classrooms, teaching and research laboratories, and computer rooms. The laboratories in the new engineering buildings are filled with state-of-the-art equipment thanks to a $2 million, two-year recipient-enhanced equipment grant awarded by Hewlett-Packard.  The grant includes computer workstations, printers, plotters, scanners, digital oscilloscopes and other high-technology data collection and data analysis equipment.The College of Engineering faculty were recruited nationally and bring to BSU a powerful union of academic excellence and industry expertise.  They have designed curricula for civil, electrical, or mechanical engineering, which is rigorous, yet comprehensive.  A significant component of the courses is laboratory work, which provides the hands-on experience potential employers expect.  The end result is that BSU graduates are well prepared to enter the job market with a competitive edge.The College of Engineering began offering master's of engineering degrees in computer, civil, electrical and mechanical engineering in the Fall 2000.  The master's program combines practical knowledge with a theoretical classroom foundation.  Nearly all of the courses include design problems, which encourage the development of engineering solutions in a group environment. The Computer Science Department moved to the College of Engineering in the summer of 2001, which includes a master's program.  In the Fall of 2003 a Master of Science in materials Science & Engineering began.

An interdisciplinary doctoral program in systems engineering, and a master's degree in Photonics are also available. The undergraduate curriculum evolves from a common core of social sciences, humanities, mathematics, natural sciences, and basic engineering courses. This core curriculum provides students with the rigorous foundation needed for the specific engineering disciplines. All of the programs of study provide students with the engineering science, design, and laboratory methods required to enter industry as fully productive engineers in their chosen fields. There are special programs available to undergraduates: a semester abroad program for the second semester of the sophomore year in Dresden, Germany; the B.S./M.S. program, whereby Boston University undergraduate students gain early admission to the Master's Degree program and complete both degrees in four to five years; the ENGMEDIC Program, which enables students interested in attending medical school to pursue an integrated curriculum and apply for early admission to Boston University Medical School; and the B.U. Collaborative Degree Program which enables students to complete a second undergraduate degree at another school or college at Boston University. In addition, participation in the College's Coop Program enables students to augment their coursework with practical experience in the workplace.  The College of Engineering offers opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in research through the Freshman Research Opportunity Program, the Research Experience for Undergraduates program and an Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program.The graduate program offers numerous research opportunities in each of the College's four departments. Research opportunities also are available in the many research centers affiliated with the College, including the Photonics Center, the Center for Information Systems Engineering, the Center for BioDynamics, the Biomolecular Engineering Research Center, the Center for Advanced Genomic Technology, the Hearing Research Center, the Neuromuscular Research Center, the Center for Advanced Biotechnology,  the Center for Space Physics, and the Center for Computational Science.The Intercollegiate Program in Bioinformatics, offered jointly by the College of Engineering and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, integrates mathematics, computation, engineering, and the biological sciences.  Through coursework, collaborative training projects, industrial co-op, and MS and PhD dissertation research, students learn to apply analytic and computational methods and information technology to current problems in biology, chemistry, and biomedical engineering.The Late Entry Accelerated Program (LEAP) is designed for non-engineers who have at least a bachelor's degree in the liberal arts, the sciences, or another field.  Applicants who fit this criterion complete a non-degree sequence of courses in basic and advanced engineering at the undergraduate level, then receive direct admission to any regular Master of Science degree program offered by the College of Engineering.

We are committed to maintaining an environment that encourages faculty and students to be profound thinkers and practical doers.  Our world-class facilities provide over 340,000 square feet of interconnected labs, classrooms, clusters, and offices designed to encourage scientists to cut across boundaries and to collaborate.  Not surprisingly, we are situated among the buildings housing the University's Biology, Chemistry, Earth and Planetary Sciences, Mathematics, and Physics departments.With our broad aims, DEAS also serves as an integrator and a connector at Harvard.  We have close links with other departments like Physics and Earth and Planetary Sciences and have increasing ties with Chemistry, Biology, and Harvard's professional schools, especially medicine and business.  Through the Technology and Entrepreneurship Center (TECH), the Industrial Outreach Program (IOP) and the Harvard Industrial Partnership (HIP), we also look to collaborate with industry and business.The undergraduate program is within Harvard College's Faculty of Arts and Sciences.  Students tackle technical, yet socially relevant issues through coursework - solving the University's parking space problems in Engineering Sciences 96 or modeling college enrollment trends in Computer Science 96 - and by doing research and fieldwork on everything from computer security to water pollution.Undergraduates can study an enormous range of topics, including, Computer Science (artificial intelligence, graphics, languages, networking, systems, and theory of computation); Engineering Sciences (bioengineering, electrical and environmental engineering, and mechanical and materials science); and Applied Mathematics (with a focus on biology, chemistry, computer science, decision and control, economics, physics, social sciences, and engineering),In addition, students can design and pursue an individualized program that cuts across the disciplines to help them best prepare for a variety of careers and activities.  For instance, those concentrating in computer science might apply their knowledge to related fields like economics, linguistics, or even brain sciences through the interdisciplinary Mind, Brain, and Behavior Program. Some focus on electrical or mechanical engineering, bioengineering, or computing and communications, to enable them to move into related industry positions immediately after graduation.  Others take a more general approach, crafting a curriculum suitable for future graduate work in medicine, law, or business.Our faculty and graduate students tackle questions from a broad range of areas including, the physics and engineering of complex systems, quantum science and technology, new materials, systems biology, and bioengineering, computer science and information technology, electrical engineeirng, and energy and the environment.We are also the home of several research centers supported by the National Science Foundation, including the Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC), the Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center (NSEC), and serve as the Northeastern Regional Center for the U.S. Department of Energy funded National Institute of Global Environmental Change (NIGEC).Members of the DEAS have invented new types of lasers, stopped light in its tracks, created nanowires one-thousandth the width of a human hair, won a host of prestigious awards, and received major government and industry grants.  They still, however, find the time to educate teachers, school kids, and the lay public about the wonders of science and engineering through outreach programs.

While other universities offer certificate programs or minor programs related to biobased products and bioenergy, ISU offers M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in this new field as well as a minor for students obtaining degrees in other majors.  The program offers students from a wide variety of science and engineering backgrounds advanced study in the use of plant- and crop-based resources for the production of biobased products, including fuels, chemicals, materials, and energy.2) The Virtual Reality Applications Center (VRAC) uses the C6 and C4 virtual environment facilities to conduct research in science and engineering applications of virtual reality.  The Center is part of the Institute for Physical Research and Technology, a network of research and outreach centers at Iowa State University.  Over thirty faculty members from sixteen departments and four colleges provide leadership for research involving 70 graduate and 60 undergraduate students.  VRAC recently opened a new flexible, \"immersive projection\" system that can create a viewing area as large as 36 feet wide and 10 feet tall\u2014equal to the area of over 400 standard 17-inch computer monitors.  This new facility, called C4, can also be made into a 12-by-12 foot room with images projected onto three walls as well as the floor.  VRAC also hosts the C6, one of the world's leading VR facilities, with six-sided projection and wireless interaction devices.  A nearby auditorium is equipped with 3D projection and display capabilities, enabling large audiences to interact with virtual worlds.  3) Iowa State University now offers graduate certificates in Information Assurance and Power Systems Engineering to on- and off-campus students.  Graduate certificates provide students the opportunity to pursue prescribed and focus areas of study at the graduate level and earn a graduate credential from ISU's Graduate College.  Typical graduate certificates include 9 to 12 credit hours of graduate work and may be completed in as little as one academic year.  Students who pursue graduate certificates complete graduate courses that may also be applied towards master's degree programs of study.  4) Iowa State University offers off-campus credit courses leading to the bachelor's degree in electrical engineering at multiple sites within Iowa and to the master's degree in electrical engineering, computer engineering, mechanical engineering, and systems engineering at multiple sites across the nation.5) Iowa State University has been designated as one of seven charter Centers of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education by the National Security Agency.  A new multidisciplinary master's of science program addresses technical and non-technical areas of the information assurance field.  Faculty members in six departments offer a set of interconnected courses that provide a firm grounding in information assurance, preparing students to embark on careers in information technology that focus on protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.6) To increase interest in graduate study at Iowa State University's Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, or Materials Science and Engineering departments, the concurrent BS/MS program allows undergraduate students the opportunity to sample graduate coursework and research.7) Iowa State University's College of Engineering and the University of Iowa's Henry B. Tippie School of Management now offer an Executive Dual Degree program in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, created especially for mid- to upper-level engineering managers and executives.  In 26 months, students earn graduate degrees from two prestigious institutions: a master of engineering in systems engineering (MESE) from Iowa State and a master of business administration (MBA) from Iowa.8) Iowa State and the College of Engineering offer numerous development opportunities for student leaders. Leadership Advantage is an intensive three-day seminar exclusively for incoming students in engineering, architecture, and the technical sciences that focuses on developing personal leadership skills, teaching awareness of leadership opportunities at Iowa State, and introducing students to the university and their specific fields of study. The Leadership through Engineering Academic Diversity (LEAD) program is committed to improving the educational experience and academic success, retention, and graduation of minority engineering students at Iowa State University. In addition, a variety of both discipline-specific clubs and general engineering honorary societies offer students numerous opportunities to build confidence and hone leadership skills.9) The College of Engineering encourages all majors to pursue opportunities for meaningful work experience before graduation through its cooperative education and internship programs. In 2002 the college placed 464 students in positions in industry, business, and government organizations related to their major fields of study\u2014more than a six-fold increase since 1997. Co-op/intern students complete the same requirements for the bachelor's degree as students in other programs, while acquiring valuable practical work experience and demonstrated workplace skills. The value of co-op and intern experiences to new engineers is obvious in placement statistics: in the spring of 2003, for example, 72% of graduating seniors with co-op or intern experience through the College of Engineering found employment upon graduating, compared to only 33% of students with no such experience.10) More than an exotic interlude in one's college career, for engineers, exposure to other peoples and cultures is critical to professional success in today's increasingly globalized economic and industrial sectors. The College of Engineering offers a host of international opportunities for students, from summer programs to full semesters and academic years abroad. Summer programs, taught in English, are available in France, Spain, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Study abroad during the regular academic year is offered in these nations and others, including Australia, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Norway, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, and Turkey. During the 2002-2003 academic year, 150 students\u2014or about 3% of undergraduates\u2014took advantage of the college's study abroad programs. In addition, 55 foreign undergraduates studied in the college at least part of the year.", "freshmen_enroll_table": "none", "sophomore_enroll_table": "none", "junior_enroll_table": "none", "senior_enroll_table": "none", "teaching_tenure_table": [["Engineering Department(s)", "Hisp", "Am Ind", "Asian", "B/AfrA", "Haw", "White", "Oth", "Total Personnel"], ["M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F"], ["Aerospace Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "4", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "10", "0", "0", "0", "14", "0"], ["Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "3", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "9", "0", "0", "0", "12", "0"], ["Chemical Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "8", "1", "0", "0", "8", "1"], ["Civil, Construction, & Environmental Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "3", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "7", "1", "0", "0", "10", "1"], ["Electrical and Computer Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "3", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "11", "1", "0", "0", "14", "1"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing", "0", "0", "0", "0", "1", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "3", "1", "0", "0", "4", "1"], ["Interdepartmental", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0"], ["Materials Science and Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "1", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "11", "1", "0", "0", "12", "1"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "3", "0", "0", "0", "1", "0", "10", "1", "0", "0", "14", "1"], ["Pre-Engineering/Specials", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0"], ["Totals:", "0", "0", "0", "0", "18", "0", "0", "0", "1", "0", "69", "6", "0", "0", "88", "6"]], "tuition": ["4342", "13684"], "sat_scores": [["SAT", "75th", "25th"], ["Math Range:", "700", "590"], ["Reading Range:", "650", "540"], ["Combined Range:", "1350", "1160"]], "act_scores": [["ACT", "75th", "25th"], ["Math Range:", "29", "22"], ["Composite Range:", "29", "24"], ["Note: ACT Composite score for new Eng. freshmen was 26.36."]], "degree_table": "none"}, {"name": "John Brown University", "type": "PRIVATE", "undergrad_enroll": "1652", "graduate_enroll": "182", "description": "The purpose of the Division of Engineering and Technology is to provide a university education integrating general studies and disciplinary studies in such a way that the student may be competent in various engineering or construction activities.The faculty of the Division seeks to establish the student in the methods of carefully and logically understanding problems and then to proceed to design solutions for those problems.

The purpose of Mercer University's School of Engineering is to educate students who are preparing to be practicing engineers, one who can responsibly contribute to a global society that is becoming ever more dependent on technology.  The school offers rigorous engineering programs at the baccalaureate and master levels and includes a solid foundation in mathematics and sciences along with a broad range of courses in engineering topics.  The program culminates in engineering design courses in which students explore solutions to recognized needs as a member of a team, since so much of modern engineering is a team effort.  Engineering courses places emphasis on communication, both written and spoken enabling graduates to effectively communicate their ideas to both technical and non-technical audiences.  Because the computer is such an essential tool for analysis, the courses integrate computer methods of problem-solving methods developed in the undergraduate engineering curriculum.

Systems engineering is available as a graduate program only. The 2 engineering schools cooperate very closely and have many jointly operated research projects and groups.  A special feature of research that evolved early in the development of the University of Missouri - Rolla is the high degree of interdisciplinary work that is routinely done.USDCC (University Student Design Competition Center) was established to promote excellence in multidisciplinary student design projects. Combining talents from all across UMR's rich curricula, students work together in order to compete on an international level against other top engineering schools. Beyond engineering, students learn management and leadership skills that will distinguish them upon graduation. Focusing on a specific multidisciplinary design gives the student a meaningful example of how to apply design principles. The experience of working on a student design team will prove intellectually stimulating, teach self-motivation, forge a sense of team pride, reveal the principles and worth of team-based leadership and instill in each participant the makings of a professional identity. The nine (9) design teams within the USDCC include: Advanced Aero Vehicle Group, Concrete Canoe Team, Formula SAE Racing Team, Human Powered Vehicle Team, Robotics Competition Team, Solar Car Team, Solar House Team, and Steel Bridge Team.

Students may opt to study other specialty topics and participate in faculty research. The University and College strive to be a national leader as a Research Intensive University focusing on undergraduate education. Over five percent of undergraduates currently participate in funded research activities each year. During the senior year COE students culminate their educational experience by participating in multidisciplinary capstone design projects. The College maintains pride in our graduates who consistently pass the FE Exam at a 92%+ rate (all graduates required to take).The undergraduate engineering programs (Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Industrial Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering) are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology. The Computing Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology has accredited the Computer Science program.In 2003 Montana State University's College of Engineering was selected as a Hewlett Foundation Engineering School of the West.In 2003, nine public colleges and universities in nine western states received William and Flora Hewlett Foundation grants to fund programs to improve the quality of undergraduate education in engineering and to increase the number of engineering graduates.These Engineering Schools of the West Initiative grants support programs to increase retention and recruitment efforts, and to improve student learning through better undergraduate teaching.The institutions, selected for a commitment to rigorous assessment and ability to sustain long-term outcomes, collaborate to tackle such issues as new ways to assess student learning or how to provide students with a global orientation to engineering problems.  Schools were chosen in part because their programs had the potential of providing a significant \"multiplier effect\" leading to a change in the institution that would also be instructive to other colleges and universities.  The Designing Our Community Program (DOC) at Montana State University seeks to establish the College of Engineering as the premier choice for Native American students.  Its first goal is to increase the motivation and pre-entry academic preparation of Native American students through recruitment activities on all seven Native American reservations in the state, visits to schools on the reservations, sponsorship of up to ten students to work on campus in engineering research and to enhance academic preparation in math in the Minority Apprenticeship Program (MAP) during the Summer. Goal number two is to help shape the engineering/engineering technology and computer science workforce by increasing the number of Native American students graduating from the College of Engineering.  As a start on this effort, several focus groups have taken place with current students in engineering in 2003 to garner feedback, assess needs and begin planning of the retention programs.  Next semester there will be a seminar course for Native Americans in Engineering.  It will serve as an academic enhancement with a learning community environment.The final goal is to improve access to quality engineering and technology to rural and underserved populations by returning highly educated professionals to these communities.  A number of programs are underway in this regard.For more information please see: http://www.montana.edu/doc.MSU College of Engineering offers a \"small school\" atmosphere combined with \"large-school\" opportunities, all in a vibrant small city located in one of the country's most outstanding areas of natural beauty.", "freshmen_enroll_table": "none", "sophomore_enroll_table": "none", "junior_enroll_table": "none", "senior_enroll_table": "none", "teaching_tenure_table": [["Engineering Department(s)", "Hisp", "Am Ind", "Asian", "B/AfrA", "Haw", "White", "Oth", "Total Personnel"], ["M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F"], ["Chemical & Biological Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "4", "0", "0", "0", "4", "0"], ["Civil Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "5", "0", "0", "0", "5", "0"], ["Computer Science", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "5", "0", "0", "0", "5", "0"], ["Electrical and Computer Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "5", "0", "0", "0", "5", "0"], ["Freshman Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0"], ["Interdisciplinary Engineering Programs", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0"], ["Mechanical & Industrial Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "1", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "5", "1", "0", "0", "6", "1"], ["Totals:", "0", "0", "0", "0", "1", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "24", "1", "0", "0", "25", "1"]], "tuition": ["4415", "12707"], "sat_scores": [["SAT", "75th", "25th"], ["Math Range:", "670", "560"], ["Note: These scores represent a change in test score reporting.

SEAS also offers a new Bachelor of General Engineering (BGE) degree, which blends elements from each discipline to provide students with a broad general knowledge base.  SEAS students are encouraged either to participate in UNH's cooperative education program or to assist a faculty member in engineering research to gain hands-on experience in their fields of study prior to graduation.  SEAS undergraduate engineering curricula are structured around design projects, engineering laboratories and computer use, and require between 121 and 131 credits for completion.  The school's dedicated full-time faculty deliver BS and BGE programs in both full-and part-time formats, and allow students to change their concentration up until their third semester of study without increasing the number of course requirements.  SEAS faculty hold doctorate degrees from over 35 internationally recognized universities and combine high-quality instruction with an emphasis on small class sizes to ensure that students receive personal attention and advising. In 1997, SEAS' electric vehicle, the Re-Charger, won four awards at the Tour del Sol race that runs from Manhattan to Washington, D.C. The project, submitted by mechanical engineering students at UNH, won Best Student Entry from the American Society of Manufacturing Engineers.

To this end, students enjoy a close relationship with full-time faculty who are licensed professionals with many years of practical experience.  While course offerings of the Civil Engineering and Geomatics Department promote education in the relevant theory common to all branches of civil engineering, engineering design concepts are emphasized and integrated throughout the curriculum.  This integration is accomplished in a sequential manner.  Early in the curriculum, elements of the creative design process are introduced as students complete simple design projects appropriate to the freshman level.  While most freshman and sophomore courses are intended to provide a solid background in mathematics, communications, the basic sciences, and the engineering sciences, certain courses provide additional concepts and methodologies supporting more advanced civil engineering design.  In junior civil engineering courses, students address practical problems of increasing complexity.  Junior courses include topics in structural engineering, hydraulics and hydrology, soil mechanics and foundations, transportation, construction management, and environmental engineering.  The Institute provides an environment where students from large and small cities, towns, and foreign countries enjoy learning together.  The Institute's ties with industry keep academic programs up to date in a rapidly-changing atmosphere.

Growth in demand for engineers and computer scientists is driven by global technology-based industrial growth, aging infrastructure and an expanding need for new infrastructure, and environmental stresses imposed by expanding human activities. The environment for engineering practice is increasingly more dynamic, in part due to: \u00b7\tGlobal accessibility to technology \u00b7\tGlobal networks of collaborative technical experts \u00b7\tSpeed of innovation as a basis for competition \u00b7\tIncreased complexity of products and services \u00b7\tIncreased impact of technological developments on society and the environment This dynamic environment places increasing demands on the education of new graduates and necessitates life-long learning for practicing engineers. Our vision is to meet the needs of this rapidly changing, global environment by:\u00b7\tEvolving our curriculum to a form in which learning is motivated by interdisciplinary engineering practice that is woven into our traditional engineering science curriculum. Through this process, our graduates will gain both fundamental knowledge of engineering practice and the social and communication skills that will make them among the best prepared for immediate engineering practice. \u00b7\tInitiating and growing collaborative, interdisciplinary research programs that are motivated by local, national and international needs for knowledge discovery. Simultaneously, our faculty will become international experts connected to a global collaborative network and our research and graduate studies programs will be seen as national assets. \u00b7\tCreating an environment for learning and discovery that will be attractive to many of the best and brightest students. The majority of Oregon's best high school graduates and outstanding students from the Northwest, across the nation, and around the world will select the College. \u00b7\tInitiating collaborative efforts that strengthen our engagement with local, national, and international constituencies.

The various curricula also provide a broad and valuable analytical background for graduates who choose to pursue careers in fields such as business, the social sciences, medicine, and law, or who wish to continue their education in graduate studies. The Institute strives to graduate scientists and engineers who are technically competent and creative, and who are aware of the roles of engineering and science in solving social problems. To achieve these goals, Rose-Hulman provides students the basic knowledge and fundamental principles on which science and engineering are based. Students are encouraged to be critical thinkers who are innovative in their approaches to problem solving. In addition, they are introduced to social and philosophical issues with which they must be concerned, both personally and professionally. Of the many qualities which distinguish Rose-Hulman and make fulfillment of its educational purposes possible, three seem most important.  First, Rose-Hulman maintains high admissions standards so that every student who is admitted should be able to complete the baccalaureate program.  A second, closely related, quality is that Rose-Hulman has remained a small, primarily undergraduate, institution by choice.  Finally, every effort is made to recruit and encourage professors who believe that teaching is their primary responsibility.  Although Rose-Hulman professors maintain their professional competence through such activities as continuing education, consulting, research, and writing, a \"publish or perish\" atmosphere is out of place on the Rose-Hulman campus.

ETM's values-based learning approach produces entrepreneurial engineers and leaders who have the technical skills, passion, and courage to make a difference. It does this through careful design of the three components of its educational system: (1) creating the environment; (2) active learning; and (3) providing the supporting infrastructure.As a department within a Catholic university, ETM creates an environment where values and ethics are the foundation of engineering education. With their extensive industry experience, ETM faculty members serve as models for both values and engineering expertise. Strong partnerships with business, industry, and other educational institutions enhance and expand the learning environment. ETM's unique model of the relationship between theory and practice differentiates it from other engineering programs. The model enables students to understand a body of knowledge as it is applied in a generic sense, and then further apply that knowledge to a specific, personal application.

Attracting students from every state and many countries around the world, UTA offers a broad array of graduate and undergraduate programs in high technology areas that prepare graduates for the 21st century. The College offers a variety of engineering disciplines, including aerospace, biomedical, civil & environmental, computer science, electrical, industrial & manufacturing systems, material science, mechanical, and software engineering. UTA engineering students enjoy an excellent learning environment, thanks to modern facilities and equipment and that many of the UTA engineering faculty are known worldwide for their research in a number of technical fields. Students also have the opportunity to acquire practical industrial experience through a cooperative education program. Graduates from engineering programs at UTA are well prepared to compete in industry. With one-third of the students in engineering pursuing advanced degrees, many participate in sponsored research activities with direct application to real-world engineering problems and solutions. Students in their junior and senior years consistently demonstrate exceptional engineering abilities by winning major national competitions. What makes UTA's College of Engineering special? All of the following: * UTA won first, second and third place four times during the first six years at the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International Aerial Robotics competition. * UTA's Computer Science and Engineering Department offers one of only nine CSE programs in the nation and is the first one in Texas to be accredited by both the Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) and Computer Accreditation Commission (CAC) of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). * The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers rates UTA's Energy Systems Research Center's power engineering program as one of the top 10 in the U.S. The center attracts students, visiting researchers and professors, and executives from around the world. *The Automation and Robotics Research Institute has a proven track record of performing world-class research for its customers, as well as an ability to transfer technology to industry quickly and effectively. More than 3000 small, medium and large companies, as well as government institutions, have received assistance through ARRI. * The Automation and Robotics Research Institute was named a winner in the Small Business Administration's First Annual Tibbetts Awards in recognition of the institute's role as a Small Business Innovation Researchers Model of Excellence. * UTA's Texas Manufacturing Assistance Center provides technical assistance to help manufacturers become more competitive. * The Controls Group at the Automation & Robotics Research Institute has Ph.D. students from around the world, including Fulbright students from Serbia, Croatia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Korea and China. * UTA engineering students have won first place overall eight times in 18 years in the national Formula SAE race car competition. UTA teams have won more national vehicle competitions than any other school in the nation. * While competing against 100 other schools in the Formula SAE design competition, teams from UTA have placed first or second 12 times in the last 18 years. * UTA's team also placed first in the inaugural International Formula Student Competition in England in the summer of 1998 and garnered the most awards in the first Australian competition in 2000, including overall first place. * Dr. Robert Woods was selected to receive the SAE's first Carroll Smith Outstanding Faculty Sponsor Award in 1999. * UTA ranks first in Texas in the number of MS graduates for electrical engineering combined with computer science and engineering. * UTA's Wave Scattering Research Center is part of a consortium of five universities working to develop new technology to detect and neutralize dangerous land mines currently deployed in more than 60 countries worldwide. * UTA was one of three universities awarded a NASA Hypersonic Research Center grant in an intense national competition in 1993. * Brig. Gen. Robert Stewart, who received a Master's in Aerospace Engineering from UTA in 1972, was a specialist on space shuttle mission STS 41-B that launched from Kennedy Space Center in February 1984. During this flight, he and Capt. Bruce McCandless participated in two extravehicular activities, representing man's first untethered operations from a spacecraft. * UTA alumna Kalpana Chawla (MSAE, '84) was the second person from UTA to fly in space and the first person from India aboard a U.S. space shuttle mission (STS-87, launched November 1997). She was a specialist on this microgravity payload flight. Her second flight, aboard STS-107, ended in tragedy February 1, 2003 as the shuttle Columbia disintegrated during reentry. * The German Space Agency presented a medallion to UTA Engineering Professor John McElroy for his work to establish the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CSEOS) and for serving as its first chair. Dr. McElroy, now retired, is a member of the National Academy of Engineering.* The Biomedical Engineering Graduate program, a joint program between UTA and The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, is one of the largest BME programs in the nation. * BME teams have developed a biocompatible coating that can be applied to artificial organs to prevent blood clots and to prevent the immune system from rejecting the implanted organ. * UTA researchers in Biomedical Engineering have fabricated artificial blood vessels from a polyurethane spray.

The undergraduate programs in Electrical and Telecommunications Engineering have been fully accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET).  The School is a member of both the Texas Telecommunications Engineering Consortium (TxTEC) and the Global Wireless Education Consortium (GWEC). Located within a five-mile radius of the Erik Jonsson campus are over 900 high-tech companies specializing in areas of microelectronics, telecommunications, signal processing, and optics.  This strong local concentration of high-tech industry allows students to work part-time as well as to co-op in classical alternating-semester fashion or intern during the summer months.  As much as seventy percent of the School's students hold co-op positions or internships with local industry sometime before graduation.The Erik Jonsson School has maintained close ties over the years with TI, Alcatel (the School has recently been named as one of five worldwide partners in Alcatel's Research Partners program), Nortel, Ericsson, Nokia, Lucent, Lockheed Martin, Intervoice, and many others.  Industry leaders have joined with the School to conduct research, share resources, enhance educational opportunities, and develop new technologies.  In collaboration with these industries, several research centers of excellence have been established.  These include the Human Language Technology Center, the Center for Integrated Circuits and Systems (CICS), the Center for Systems, Communications, and Signal Processing (CSCSP), the Digital Forensics and Emergency Preparedness Institute, the Embedded Software Center (ESC), the Photonic Technology and Engineering Center (PhoTEC), and the Center for Advanced Telecommunications Systems and Services (CATSS).Most recently, the Jonsson School and UTD have become poised for a new era of growth and excellence in education and research, based in large part on a $300 million initiative involving the State of Texas, the University of Texas System, and Texas Instruments.  The 5-year plan, announced in June 2003, includes design and construction of a 200,000 sq. ft. research center for engineering and natural sciences, to be completed in 2006.  The new facility will serve not only to broaden the scope of current engineering research, but also to foster new, interdisciplinary programs with faculty in related sciences such as physics, chemistry, and molecular biology, as well as the arts and humanities.For more information on the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science, please visit the school website: http://www.utdallas.edu/dept/eecs/Landmark events in the history of UTD and the Erik Jonsson School include:\u2022\tIn 1969, founders of Texas Instruments offered their private research and development institution to the State of Texas to become part of the University of Texas System.  \u2022\tIn 1986, the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board authorized UTD's Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science to prepare students to tackle the rapidly changing world of technology and communications.\u2022\tIn 1987, UTD dedicated the Multipurpose/Start-up building, the first home of the Erik Jonsson School.\u2022\tAlso in 1987, the Regents of the University of Texas System established the Lars Magnus Ericsson Chair in Electrical Engineering.\u2022\tIn 1989, the Erik Jonsson School granted its first engineering degree. \u2022\tIn 1992, UTD dedicated a $12 million state-of-the-art Engineering and Computer Science building.  \u2022\tIn 1998, UTD researchers developed the Matrix Repository System (MRS), a highly secure system for storing proprietary telecommunications industry matrix data, for the Quality Excellence for Suppliers of Telecommunications (QuEST) forum.\u2022\tIn 1999, UTD's collaborative online program with the University of Texas at Arlington began providing graduate level education for telecommunication professionals. \u2022\tIn August 2002, a new 150,000 sq. ft. engineering building opened its doors.  The new facility, constructed with a combination of state and private funding, doubled the Jonsson School's physical size to more than 300,000 sq. ft., including ten new classrooms equipped with state-of-the-art audiovisual facilities. \u2022\tIn November 2002, UTD initiated three new PhD programs: Telecommunications Engineering, Computer Engineering, and Software Engineering.  The Telecommunications Engineering doctoral degree is the first of its kind in North America, and the Software Engineering doctoral degree is the first in Texas.\u2022\tIn 2003, Kiplinger's Personal Finance rated UTD 34th among the 100 Best-valued Public Schools in the United States. \u2022\tIn May 2003, Dr. Robert Helms, President and CEO of International SEMATECH and Professor Emeritus at Stanford, was named Dean of the Erik Jonsson School.\u2022\tIn June 2003, a major joint initiative among the State of Texas, the University of Texas System, and Texas Instruments was announced that will bring $300 million in funding for education and research at UTD over a 5-year period.

Many have become executives in major corporations and businesses, or technological entrepreneurs.PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE YEAR (PEY)The Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering has long recognized the importance of practical professional experience in engineering education. Introduced in 1979, the Professional Experience Year (PEY) internship program provides a unique opportunity for companies to benefit from, and to assess, the capabilities of prospective young employees and enhances the educational experience of the student. PEY provides full-time undergraduate students who have successfully completed two or three years of their academic program with the opportunity to obtain valuable working experience over a twelve- to sixteen-month period.  In 1979, PEY began by placing eight students from the Department of Mechanical Engineering in sixteen-month work terms at Ontario Hydro, General Motors, and de Havilland.  Since then, students from all engineering programs have found jobs through the PEY Program.  Computer Science students from the Faculty of Arts and Science participated for the first time in May, 1989; several other departments from Arts and Science have since been involved with the Program.  To date, thousands of U of T students have found employment through PEY.ENGINEERING SCIENCE The Engineering Science program is designed for students primarily interested in the application of science to modern technology, and who wish to prepare themselves for careers in applied research, advanced engineering design or teaching.  The courses offered in Engineering Science are of high standard; only students with superior ability in, and aptitude for, mathematics and science can expect to succeed in them.JEFFREY SKOLL BASC/MBA PROGRAMThe Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering and the Joseph L. Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto have established a program unequalled in Canada, which provides a fast track for gifted students to earn their Bachelor's degree in engineering, a one-year managment internship and an MBA.  The Jeffrey Skoll BASc/MBA Program is the only one in Canada offering these two degrees in one combined program.  For more information, check the Program web site: www.rotman.utoronto.ca/skollENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING COLLABORATIVE PROGRAMIn response to the increasing demands on engineers to address environmental issues, the Faculty has established a set of options by which students in the Chemical and Civil Engineering programs may choose enriched studies in environmental engineering.  This is offered as a Collaborative Program between the two departments, and is coordinated by the Division of Environmental Engineering.  The Environmental Engineering (Collaborative Program) is where over 25 full-time faculty members in chemical, civil, mechanical  and industrial engineering, and materials science teach and carry out  research in various areas of environmental engineering.THE LASSONDE MINING INSTITUTEThe Lassonde Mining Institute was established to facilitate research on important problems related to the mining and mineral industries.  Graduate studies in mineral engineering may be pursued through the Departments of Civil Engineering, and Materials Science and Engineering.INTERNATIONAL STUDENT EXCHANGESThe International Student Exchange Office (ISXO) administers university-wide international and Canadian exchanges for University of Toronto students.  The exchange programs offer students a variety of opportunities to study at partner institutions while gaining an understanding of different cultures, heritage, values and lifestyles found across borders.Exchange programs operate under formal agreements between the University of Toronto and partner universities abroad and in Canada.  University of Toronto students who participate in exchange programs pay full-time tuition and compulsory incidental fees to the University of Toronto.  Students can then study at one of the University of Toronto's partner universities without paying tuition fees at the host university.", "freshmen_enroll_table": "none", "sophomore_enroll_table": "none", "junior_enroll_table": "none", "senior_enroll_table": "none", "teaching_tenure_table": [["Engineering Department(s)", "Hisp", "Am Ind", "Asian", "B/AfrA", "Haw", "White", "Oth", "Total Personnel"], ["M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F"], ["Department of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "20", "1", "20", "1"], ["Department of Civil Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "15", "0", "15", "0"], ["Department of Materials Science and Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "10", "0", "10", "0"], ["Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "27", "0", "27", "0"], ["Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0"], ["Division of Engineering Science", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0"], ["Division of Mineral Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "1", "0", "1", "0"], ["Edward S.

The resulting broad education enables an impressive number of Yale Engineering graduates to be successful in their careers and to assume positions of leadership in many segments of society.The Yale Faculty of Engineering offers majors in Biomedical, Chemical, Electrical, Environmental, Mechanical Engineering, and Applied Physics. Each major provides many options. Engineering students may also pursue engineering-related majors in Electrical Engineering/Computer Science, Computer Science, and Applied Mathematics. A number of students choose to graduate with a double major, for example, Engineering and Music/Economics/Psychology.Students who have their sights set on leadership positions in industry enroll in the Select Program in Engineering and graduate in five years with a Master of Engineering degree as well as hands-on industrial experience, acquired during two summer internships in industry.At Yale, it is faculty, not graduate students, who teach undergraduates. The faculty-to-senior ratio is approximately one to one, and students enjoy much individual guidance. Faculty not only supervise student projects but also involve them in their own research. Faculty acknowledge their student researchers in published research papers, which means that some students graduate with their name on scientific publications. Engineering has a 150-year history at Yale (1852-2002). The first Engineering Ph.D. in the U.S. was awarded at Yale, in 1863. The recipient was J. Willard Gibbs who went on to become a leading scientist of the nineteenth centur", "freshmen_enroll_table": "none", "sophomore_enroll_table": "none", "junior_enroll_table": "none", "senior_enroll_table": "none", "teaching_tenure_table": [["Engineering Department(s)", "Hisp", "Am Ind", "Asian", "B/AfrA", "Haw", "White", "Oth", "Total Personnel"], ["M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F"], ["Applied Physics", "0", "0", "0", "0", "1", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "9", "0", "0", "0", "10", "0"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "4", "0", "0", "0", "4", "0"], ["Chemical Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "7", "1", "0", "0", "7", "1"], ["Electrical Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "2", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "5", "0", "0", "0", "7", "0"], ["Engineering and Applied Science", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "4", "0", "0", "0", "4", "0"], ["Totals:", "0", "0", "0", "0", "3", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "29", "1", "0", "0", "32", "1"]], "tuition": ["28400"], "sat_scores": "none", "act_scores": "none", "degree_table": "none"}]
