Yale's demanding engineering education is significantly enhanced by courses in the humanities, social sciences, the arts, and foreign languages, which engineering majors take alongside humanities majors. The resulting broad education enables an impressive number of Yale Engineering graduates to be successful in their careers and to assume positions of leadership in many segments of society.

The School of Engineering & Applied Science offers majors in Biomedical, Chemical, Electrical, Environmental and Mechanical Engineering. Each major provides many options. Engineering students may also pursue engineering-related majors in Electrical Engineering/Computer Science, Computer Science, and Applied Mathematics. A number of students choose to graduate with a double major, for example, Engineering and Music/Economics/Psychology.

At Yale, it is faculty, not graduate students, who teach undergraduates. The faculty-to-senior ratio is approximately one to one, and students enjoy much individual guidance. Faculty not only supervise student projects but also involve them in their own research. Faculty acknowledge their student researchers in published research papers, which means that some students graduate with their name on scientific publications. 

Engineering has a 160-year history at Yale (1852-2012). The first Engineering Ph.D. in the U.S. was awarded at Yale, in 1863. The recipient was J. Willard Gibbs, who went on to become a leading scientist of the nineteenth century.","[{""faculty_departments"":""Biomedical Engineering""},{""faculty_departments"":""Chemical & Environmental Engineering""},{""faculty_departments"":""Computer Science""},{""faculty_departments"":""Electrical Engineering""},{""faculty_departments"":""Engineering and Applied Science""},{""faculty_departments"":""Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science""},{""faculty_departments"":""Totals:""}]","[{""faculty_numbers"":""17""},{""faculty_numbers"":""13""},{""faculty_numbers"":""22""},{""faculty_numbers"":""14""},{""faculty_numbers"":""0""},{""faculty_numbers"":""13""},{""faculty_numbers"":""79""}]","$53,430","6,959","443","267","[{""ug_sat"":""Math Range:""},{""ug_sat"":""""},{""ug_sat"":""""},{""ug_sat"":""Reading Range:""},{""ug_sat"":""""},{""ug_sat"":""""},{""ug_sat"":""Writing Range:""},{""ug_sat"":""""},{""ug_sat"":""""},{""ug_sat"":""Combined Range:""},{""ug_sat"":""""},{""ug_sat"":""""}]","[{""ug_act"":""Math Range:""},{""ug_act"":""""},{""ug_act"":""""},{""ug_act"":""Composite Range:""},{""ug_act"":""33""},{""ug_act"":""35""}]","$42,100","1,616","227","103"

The School is focused on two equally important and interlocking goals :

- Academic programs enhanced by project-based learning to prepare our students for success in their careers.

- Faculty engagement in productive partnerships with business and industry for economic development.

Project-Based Learning

First, by providing project-based learning, we ensure that our graduates are well prepared for success in their careers. Our students are mastering their academic studies in Engineering and Technology and in Construction Management; they are actively involved in using what they are learning. By tackling real projects drawn from industry, they are acquiring hands-on experience in team work, problem solving, goal setting, conflict resolution, deadline management, effective planning, and other critical skills. They graduate with theoretical and practical knowledge as well as actual proof that they can use their knowledge to accomplish results.

Productive Partnerships

Second, we offer expertise and technical resources to business across the region.

The College’s rapidly expanding research base is a true reflection of faculty expertise, and our undergraduate and graduate students benefit from the classroom and laboratory experiences that this research provides. 

Our graduates are well prepared for careers and advanced study, as our undergraduate and graduate students both work closely with faculty and with each other. Student design teams have made discoveries leading to patents, new products, and start-up companies. Our alumni have gone on to distinguished careers as innovators in industry, outstanding educators, and highly ranked government leaders.  Each of our academic programs provides opportunities for students to work with and learn from experts in their respective fields.

•	The Department of Atmospheric Science is a top-rated department focused on graduate education, cutting-edge research, and public service. We currently have 17 faculty members, nearly one hundred graduate students, approximately 50 full-time researchers, and an outstanding and dedicated support staff. Our diverse areas of research include Cloud Microphysics, Severe Storms and Mesoscale Meteorology, Atmospheric Chemistry and Air Quality, Radiation and Remote Sensing, Climate and Atmosphere-Ocean Dynamics, and Global Biogeochemical Cycles and Ecosystems. We offer graduate degrees at both the M.S. and Ph.D. levels. We focus on atmospheric science, climate modeling, and environmental sciences are ranked among the top programs in the world. Cross-disciplinary focus and activities allow us to build on this reputation to solve not just today's global problems, but also those of tomorrow.

•	The Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering’s goal is to educate future leaders who effectively combine their broad knowledge of mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology with their engineering analysis and design skills for the creative solution of problems in chemical and biological technology and for the synthesis of innovative processes and products.

•	The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering is internationally recognized for our research, education, and outreach focused on providing sustainable and resilient solutions to improve the quality of life for all society. We have a rich legacy of excellence in Water Engineering and Science, which includes research in the areas of hydrology, hydraulics, and water resources. We also have enhanced our programs in Environmental and Energy Systems, including research focused on resource recovery and efficiency,  environmental informatics, engineered systems for climate change, rational remediation, and pollutant transport at the human/environment intreface, and in  Infrastructure Systems, with research focused on the resiliency of structures and communities impacted by natural hazards, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, flooding, and tsunamis.

•	The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering has been a leader in innovation for more than a century. Building on our existing strengths, we are redefining what it means to both teach and learn in the ECE department. Rather than teaching courses in isolation, our faculty will work in teams to hook students' interest earlier by showing them how concepts connect across the curriculum and how that knowledge relates to the real world. As we begin to see the impact of our work, we hope you join us in extending our successes beyond Colorado State University.

•	The Department of Mechanical Engineering program offers a curriculum that combines classroom learning with engineering practice. Our goal is to give our graduates the engineering skills they need to obtain leading positions in advanced technology fields.

•	The School of Biomedical Engineering is an interdisciplinary school with faculty from multiple departments and colleges.  It provides transdisciplinary education, research, and practical experiences throughout a full range of degree programs. The unique structure of the School involves four colleges, 14 departments, and over 70 faculty. Academic excellence across diverse fields converges into three primary areas of research: (1) regenerative and rehabilitative medicine, (2) imaging and diagnostics, and (3) medical devices and therapeutics.","[{""faculty_departments"":""Atmospheric Science""},{""faculty_departments"":""Biomedical Engineering""},{""faculty_departments"":""Chemical & Biological Engineering""},{""faculty_departments"":""Civil & Environmental Engineering""},{""faculty_departments"":""Electrical & Computer Engineering""},{""faculty_departments"":""Engineering Sciences""},{""faculty_departments"":""Mechanical Engineering""},{""faculty_departments"":""Walter Scott, Jr. College of Engineering""},{""faculty_departments"":""Totals:""}]","[{""faculty_numbers"":""18""},{""faculty_numbers"":""0""},{""faculty_numbers"":""13""},{""faculty_numbers"":""33""},{""faculty_numbers"":""26""},{""faculty_numbers"":""0""},{""faculty_numbers"":""34""},{""faculty_numbers"":""0""},{""faculty_numbers"":""124""}]","null","2,615","null","null","[]","[{""ug_act"":""Math Range:""},{""ug_act"":""""},{""ug_act"":""""},{""ug_act"":""Reading Range:""},{""ug_act"":""""},{""ug_act"":""""},{""ug_act"":""Writing Range:""},{""ug_act"":""""},{""ug_act"":""""},{""ug_act"":""Combined Range:""},{""ug_act"":""""},{""ug_act"":""""}]","null","2,206","null","null"

Projects can be sponsored by a variety of sources, both corporate or academic, and are executed by an individual student or team of students. Projects in the recent past include:  Bioengineering--A two-semester design course provides an opportunity for students to synthesize and extend the skills and knowledge acquired during undergraduate education in design (or redesign) of a medical product. Students are exposed to key facets of medical product design and develop an understanding of the unique regulatory and reimbursement requirements. Educational objectives include (1) leveraging state-of-the-art design tools such as computer aided engineering (SolidWorks 2017), finite element analysis and computational fluid mechanics (SolidWorks Simulation and Flow Simulation), and data interfacing and control (LabVIEW); (2) developing the student’s ability to synthesize and apply engineering and scientific principles to solution of real-world problems; (3) an introduction to unique requirements medical product design process; (4) assessment/prediction component and product reliability; (5) construction of verification and validation plans including incorporation of statistical design of experiments (DOX) techniques (DesignExpert); (6) developing the student’s ability to effectively document and communicate throughout the product design process - both orally and in writing; (7) introduction to relevant business model discovery and accounting, finance (e.g., the time value of money), and marketing principles including use of the Osterwalder business model canvas to evaluate product-market fit; (8) introduction to the fabrication and mass-production techniques used in the medical product industry, and (9) developing an ability to identify an unmet clinical need using ethnographic techniques.   BIOENG 1160 (Senior Design 1): Student design teams are formed and unmet clinical needs identified to align with the strengths and interests of the team and serve as the basis for the design project topic. A range of client, clinical, and technical mentors serve as advisors to the student teams. The first semester culminates with student presentation of an initial product prototype at the Swanson Design Expo and formulation of a risk-based design history file containing all essential documents. Verification and validation plan and testing protocols guide student teams during evaluation and iterative refinement activities in the second semester. The design history file establishes the criteria by that success of the team's project efforts will be evaluated in the second semester. BIOENG 1161 (Senior Design 2): Student teams continue execution of their design projects with a focus on verification and, in particular, validation activities. The second semester culminates with each student team giving an oral or poster presentation at one or more design competitions and conferences with special emphasis on whether their project work achieves the goals established in in each team's design history file. Final team evaluation is based on the thoughtfulness and thoroughness of the completed project and final design history file submission (evaluated, within reason, consisting with FDA’s Quality System Inspection Technique). Chemical--We offer two types of design projects: a senior level chemical engineering plant design project and a junior level chemical engineering product design project.  Plant Design: The design, simulation, pinch analysis and economic analysis of a chemical plant.   Using the AspenPlus process simulator, heat exchanger design software, process evaluator, and the Aveva 3-D plant design software, a complete chemical plant is designed. Health and safety issues are also examined. Fundamental aspects of product design are also incorporated.    Product Design:  Customer problems are identified through the use of ethnography and customer survey techniques.  Students then brainstorm ideas and narrow down to a potential solution.  Students are then required to create specifications for the chemical product prototype, describing how they verified it meets customer needs and prepare a business plan that documents how this proposed solution could be translated into practice.  At the end of the course, student groups must prepare a business pitch on their intended project.  Civil and Environmental--An infrastructure design project for a native village in Panama associated with its water supply systems; design of a master plan for the infrastructure development of a summer camp on thirty wooded acres in Collier Township, design of a quarter mile long underpass for Bigelow Boulevard between O’Hara Street and Forbes Avenue to provide a seamless campus between the Student Union and the Cathedral of Learning, and development of a comprehensive integrated construction management plan for construction of a resort hotel at Conneaut Lake.  Computer/Electrical--Smart DC Breakers, Targeted Eclipsing Car High Beams, An ASL Translation Glove, Smart Security System for College Students, Advanced eye tracker for Strabismus and Amblyopia, Low Cost Wireless Bicycle Power Meter, Smart Doorbell, Sun-Tracking Charging Station, Firefighting Swarm Robotics, Semi-Truck Backup Assistant, Volume Leveling Speakers, IoT Cloud Garden, CPR Training Glove, Smart Headphones.

Each team is organized as a distinctive IPRO course section and may include 7 to 15 students from all academic levels (sophomore through graduate school), and across 
IIT's professional programs (engineering, science, business, law, psychology, design, and architecture), with a typical team size 
of eleven students. One or more instructors from any of IIT's academic units may guide an IPRO team, depending on the nature of the problem-solving challenge and often in collaboration with workplace professionals. Approximately 90 projects are completed each year, encompassing experiences in research, design, process improvement, 
sustainability, service learning and venture development. Integration of both vertical (bridging academic levels) and horizontal (bridging professional programs) dimensions within a project team experience, guided by 
virtually any faculty member at the university, is distinctive in higher education today -- stimulating student interaction across the 
boundaries of individual disciplines and experiences.

The IPRO Program prepares students for the practical challenges they will face in a changing workplace, emulating a cross-functional team operating environment and grappling with the complex multifaceted 
issues of our time. The core learning objectives, regardless of the specific nature of a problem-solving topic, encompass teamwork, project management and communication, as well as consideration of 
ethics and other non-technical issues that influence decision-making. This gives engineering and technology-oriented students a greater appreciation for non-technical considerations, while at the same time 
instilling in students of law, business and other professions greater insight concerning the process of research and technology development. Through the completion of at least two semester-long IPRO team 
projects, students develop a unique portfolio of real-world experience that hones their skills, applies their knowledge and focuses their 
attention on career directions that best fit their aptitude and interest. Visit http://ipro.iit.edu.

Each engineering major also includes extensive design content within its Bachelor of Science curriculum, culminating in a major design experience in the senior year.","[{""faculty_departments"":""Biomedical Engineering""},{""faculty_departments"":""CHEMICAL and Biological Engineering""},{""faculty_departments"":""Chemical and BIOLOGICAL Engineering""},{""faculty_departments"":""CIVIL, Architectural and Environmental Engineering""},{""faculty_departments"":""Civil, ARCHITECTURAL and Environmental Engineering""},{""faculty_departments"":""Civil, Architectural and ENVIRONMENTAL Engineering""},{""faculty_departments"":""Computer Science1""},{""faculty_departments"":""ELECTRICAL and Computer Engineering""},{""faculty_departments"":""Electrical and COMPUTER Engineering""},{""faculty_departments"":""Mechanical, Materials and AEROSPACE Engineering""},{""faculty_departments"":""Mechanical, MATERIALS and Aerospace Engineering""},{""faculty_departments"":""MECHANICAL, Materials and Aerospace Engineering""},{""faculty_departments"":""Undeclared""},{""faculty_departments"":""Totals:""}]","[{""faculty_numbers"":""0""},{""faculty_numbers"":""0""},{""faculty_numbers"":""0""},{""faculty_numbers"":""0""},{""faculty_numbers"":""0""},{""faculty_numbers"":""0""},{""faculty_numbers"":""0""},{""faculty_numbers"":""0""},{""faculty_numbers"":""0""},{""faculty_numbers"":""0""},{""faculty_numbers"":""0""},{""faculty_numbers"":""0""},{""faculty_numbers"":""0""},{""faculty_numbers"":""0""}]","$45,872","2,296","1,382","295","[{""ug_sat"":""Math Section:""},{""ug_sat"":""""},{""ug_sat"":""""},{""ug_sat"":""Evidence-Based Reading and Writing Section:""},{""ug_sat"":""""},{""ug_sat"":""""},{""ug_sat"":""Total Score:""},{""ug_sat"":""""},{""ug_sat"":""""}]","[{""ug_act"":""Math Range:""},{""ug_act"":""33""},{""ug_act"":""28""},{""ug_act"":""Composite Range:""},{""ug_act"":""32""},{""ug_act"":""27""}]","$31,947","4,132","2,606","424"

Electrical & Computer Engineering students participate in a year-long Senior Design Project experience in which groups of students employ engineering science principles and design practices to design and prototype a novel device or system.  In Chemical Engineering, students design experiments in separation, process control, chemical reactions, and polymer processing.  Civil Engineering students work in teams to design civil engineering projects. They consider schedules, economic factors, feasibility studies, alternative solutions and detailed analysis to produce oral and written reports on their comprehensive designs.  Mechanical Engineering juniors undertake redesign projects in groups as part of a Design of Mechanical Components class.  Senior year, students complete 3 smaller projects in the first semester, one of which is done in groups.  Students in the second semester work in groups to complete larger, unstructured design problems culminating in a working prototype.  The senior design activity in Industrial Engineering consists of a seminar in which student design teams are formed, needs are assessed and projects defined.  This is followed by a course in which the design projects are completed, reported on and presented to design clients and the class.  
In addition to these course-based design activities, many students participate in co-curricular design projects. These include the design and development of vehicle for the SAE Supermilage Competition; the design of a concrete canoe and a steel bridge, both for an ASCE competitions; the design of a rocket and payload systems for the NASA Student Launch Competition; and a vehicle for the AIChE sponsored Chem-E-Car Competition.","[]","[]","null","8,830","null","null","[]","[]","null","3,881","null","null"

The College of Liberal Arts served as the University's academic cornerstone.  Its School of Engineering was established in 1985 as the third academic unit offering baccalaureate degrees.  The purpose of the School of Engineering is to educate students who are preparing to be practicing engineers, individuals who can responsibly contribute to a global society that is becoming ever more dependent on technology.  An engineer takes the discoveries of the scientist, the tools of the mathematician, and the imagination of the inventor and transforms them into goods, services, and information to satisfy human needs.  Mercer's School of Engineering offers rigorous engineering programs at the baccalaureate and master levels and includes a solid foundation in mathematics and sciences along with a broad range of courses in engineering topics.  The program culminates in engineering design courses in which students explore solutions to recognized needs as a member of a team, since so much of modern engineering is a team effort.  Engineering courses places emphasis on the written and spoken word; enabling graduates to effectively communicate their ideas to both technical and non-technical audiences.  Because the computer is such an essential tool for analysis, the courses integrate computer methods of problem-solving.  Within the engineering curriculum are the general education requirements which promote social, cultural, and global awareness, and draw on Mercer University's distinguished Judaeo-Christian ethical value structure.  All of this contributes to the development of a practicing engineer who is a responsible contributor to the global society.  Additionally, the School of Engineering concentrates on developing outstanding laboratory and design competencies; all students experience interdisciplinary team work at the senior level.  The school achieves very high levels of faculty-student interaction throughout its curriculum.  The faculty within the engineering school is dedicated to staying abreast of the latest developments and conveying that current practice to the students in a supportive environment.  Each student is encouraged and expected to draw on faculty assistance for knowledge, motivation, value clarification, and transition to the world of engineering.  The Mercer Bachelor of Science in Engineering (BSE) program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, Inc.  In addition to specializations that lead to a Bachelor of Science in Engineering, the School of Engineering offers two Bachelor of Science (BS) degree programs.  The Bachelor of Science in Industrial Management focuses on applying selected engineering tools to management decisions.  The Bachelor of Science in Technical Communication provides a foundation in sciences, mathematics and technology with a strong emphasis on communication skills.  Both of the BS programs are intended to provide a technical, scientific, and analytical foundation so the graduate can pursue engineering-related careers that require some engineering-like expertise.  The programs are a mutual effort between the School of Engineering, the College of Liberal Arts, and the Stetson School of Business.  Other schools at Mercer University include Tift College of Education, the School of Medicine, the Townsend School of Music, Walter F. George School of Law, College of Pharmacy and Health Science, James and Carolyn McAfee School of Theology, and Georgia Baptist School of Nursing.","[{""faculty_departments"":""Biomedical""},{""faculty_departments"":""Civil""},{""faculty_departments"":""Computer""},{""faculty_departments"":""Electrical""},{""faculty_departments"":""Environmental""},{""faculty_departments"":""Industrial""},{""faculty_departments"":""Industrial Management""},{""faculty_departments"":""Mechanical""},{""faculty_departments"":""School of Engineering""},{""faculty_departments"":""Software Engineering""},{""faculty_departments"":""Software Systems""},{""faculty_departments"":""Technical Communication""},{""faculty_departments"":""Totals:""}]","[{""faculty_numbers"":""0.00""},{""faculty_numbers"":""0.00""},{""faculty_numbers"":""0.00""},{""faculty_numbers"":""0.00""},{""faculty_numbers"":""0.00""},{""faculty_numbers"":""0.00""},{""faculty_numbers"":""0.00""},{""faculty_numbers"":""0.00""},{""faculty_numbers"":""0.00""},{""faculty_numbers"":""0.00""},{""faculty_numbers"":""0.00""},{""faculty_numbers"":""0.00""},{""faculty_numbers"":""0.00""}]","","896","643","198","[{""ug_sat"":""Math Section:""},{""ug_sat"":""""},{""ug_sat"":""""},{""ug_sat"":""Evidence-Based Reading and Writing Section:""},{""ug_sat"":""""},{""ug_sat"":""""},{""ug_sat"":""Total Score:""},{""ug_sat"":""""},{""ug_sat"":""""}]","[{""ug_act"":""Math Range:""},{""ug_act"":""31""},{""ug_act"":""26""},{""ug_act"":""Composite Range:""},{""ug_act"":""31""},{""ug_act"":""26""}]","","","",""

Students participate in industry-sponsored capstone design projects with industry mentors and faculty. The capstone design project in each major helps students to integrate the technical concepts learned in the courses they have taken. The experience aims to impart a foundation in team leadership and project management ability that will allow graduate to move with purpose, positively impacting the concerns they will soon face. Engineering students have the option of participating with students in other majors in an integrated capstone project that covers two semesters and simulates an authentic professional engineering/computing/information experience. 

Entrepreneurship Opportunities
UMBC students can elect to take a minor in entrepreneurship and innovation through the Alex.Brown Center for Entrepreneurship (https://entrepreneurship.umbc.edu/). Students may participate in an ""idea competition"" to pitch ideas for new businesses or campus programs. Graduate and undergraduate students may develop and enter their business plans in an on campus competition and then to a regional and national business plan and Entrepreneurial events. The Cangialosi Business Innovation Competition gives students a “real world” experience in starting their own business. Students are paired with a business mentor who provides feedback and guidance and connects them to the local entrepreneurial community.","[]","[]","null","4,712","null","null","[]","[]","null","1,566","null","null"

Engineering is also home to numerous research centers, laboratories, and institutes, all supported by substantial external funding. Research activities in these centers transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries, and allow multiple perspectives and expertise to focus on broad research programs of national significance. Major interdisciplinary centers include the Center for Environmentally Beneficial Catalysis; the Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets; Information and Telecommunications Technology Center; the Kansas University Transportation Center; and the Institute for Bioengineering Research. 

Engineering faculty members are drawn from engineering and the sciences, and some hold joint appointments with the School of Pharmacy (Pharmaceutical Chemistry).  

Combined undergraduate programs are available for students interested in pursuing joint degrees in Business/Civil or Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering/Biomedical, Chemical Engineering/Environmental and Chemical/Pre-medical.  Undergraduate engineering students may minor in dozens of areas of study within the other College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and other professional schools at the University of Kansas. There are extensive Study Abroad opportunities available.

Most departments have more than one master’s program to meet the interest of students with different career goals. Traditional and Fast Track Ph.D. programs are available. The latter are for exceptionally qualified students who intend to follow a research or university career path. 

The School of Engineering Career Center helps students who seek permanent employment and internships in corporations and agencies worldwide.","[]","[]","null","2,020","null","null","[{""ug_sat"":""Aerospace Engineering""},{""ug_sat"":""Aerodynamics, Propolsion and CFD\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAerospace Vehicle Design and Unmanned Aerial Systems\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStructures and Materials \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDynamics and Controls""},{""ug_sat"":""Bioengineering""},{""ug_sat"":""Biomechanics\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTissue Engineering \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBioinformatics\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBiomolecular Engineering\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBioimaging\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBiomaterials""},{""ug_sat"":""Chemical and Petroleum Engineering""},{""ug_sat"":""Catalysis and Reaction Engineering\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEnhanced Oil Recovery and Reservoir Engineering\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tElectrochemical Engineering and Fuel Cells\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRenewable Fuels""},{""ug_sat"":""Civil, Environmental & Architectural Engineering""},{""ug_sat"":""Structural Engineering and Materials\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEnvironmental Engineering and Science\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWater Resources Engineering\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBuilding Systems (Lighting/Thermal)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGeotechnical Engineering\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTransportation Systems\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tConstruction Management and Engineering\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tConcrete Materials\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBuilding Thermal Systems\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCorrosion of Metals\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFracture & Fatigue of Metals\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTimber Structures""},{""ug_sat"":""Electrical Engineering and Computer Science""},{""ug_sat"":""Security and Assurance\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRadar Systems and Remote Sensing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHigh-Assurance Systems Design and Verification\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCommunications Systems \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIntelligent Informatics\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetwork Systems and  Engineering\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRF Systems Engineering\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSignal Processing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tComputing in the Biosciences\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApplied  Electromagnetics\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLanguages and Semantics\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tComputer Systems Design\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPower Systems\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage Processing/Visulaization\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tData Science""},{""ug_sat"":""Engineering & Project Management""},{""ug_sat"":""Project Management\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tConsulting Engineering Services\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStrategic Analysis of Technology Projects\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFinance for the Engineering or Project Management""},{""ug_sat"":""Engineering Physics""},{""ug_sat"":""Biophysics\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpace Physics\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCondensed Matter Physics\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNuclear Physics\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tParticle Physics\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAstrophysics & Astronomy""},{""ug_sat"":""Mechanical Engineering""},{""ug_sat"":""Biomechanics/Biomaterials/Biofluids/Biosystems\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEnergy and Transportation \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tComputational Mechanics and Computational Fluid Dynamics""}]","[]","null","563","null","null"

There's much more to engineering than just engineering.”  

Experiential learning is at the core of a strong Missouri S&T education. Extracurricular student design teams do more than just prepare students for their first jobs; they push students to become industry leaders.  

All S&T students, regardless of discipline or age, are encouraged to join a design team. The moment they set foot on campus, freshman and transfer students can become part of a thriving, innovative and supportive community, simply by joining a student design team.

Design teams run the gamut from building (and racing) concrete canoes that hold up to four people, high-altitude rockets, to the 2017 world champion Mars Rover Team; formula-one style race cars, automated drilling platforms, and bacterial DNA modified to produce biological “machines.”  Even flying or swimming robots, structural bridges, human-powered vehicles, up to nuclear science projects and motorcycles.  There’s a team for every student’s interest.   Can’t find one you like?  Start your own.   That exactly how each team came to be.

Team operations focus on learning the process of global product development. Teams mirror what small start-ups do to be successful; start with an idea, build (and maintain) an organization around that idea, and produce a market-based solution.  Students manage their projects, raise funds, communicate their ideas, and solve open-ended design challenges, usually in industry sponsored events.  They take risks and break rules when necessary to get the job done.  They sometimes fail, but that’s when the real learning takes place. 

Over past decade, S&T design teams have even undertake organizing and running intercollegiate competitions.  If they couldn’t find an industry event, they established their own to maintain the team focus, get experience, and build relationships with their competitors.

Team members, regardless of major, leave S&T as experienced process engineers who know how to solve real world problems, don’t mind getting their hands dirty, and can think on their feet. There are productive from their first day on their ‘real’ job because they understand the process of global product development. 

The S&T Student Design and Experiential Learning Center (SDELC), housed in the Kummer Student Design Center, is the business and manufacturing incubator for twenty student teams.  The SDELC provides teams with advanced computer design labs, a complete manufacturing center, office and meeting space, and logistical support assets. Center staff assist with the technical, marketing, communication and fundraising support that prepares students for successful careers, but the students, undergraduates all, do the work.  

These student-run, multi-disciplinary S&T design teams, are comprised of over 1,200 students drawn from every major on campus.  Team members have 24-7 facility access, are responsible first to their own leaders and teammates, and chart their own course. This centralized program, one of only a handful in the nation, has resulted in consistent excellence in intercollegiate competitions, strengthening S&T’s reputation in both industry and academia.  What’s more, the SDELC has become a model for other universities to emulate.  It is common for other schools’ teams to ask S&T “how do we get what you have?”, and S&T’s teams and SDELC support staff are only too happy to mentor other schools.

The design team program is perhaps the single most effective marketing asset Missouri S&T has.  The SDELC is the top draw for campus visitors, and industry from all over the globe aggressively recruit design team alumni.  Not only do design teams supply industry with top-tier talent, most teams have aggressive outreach programs that target middle, junior high and high school students.  The goal is to inspire youth with the fun and adventure that careers in science and technology can provide. In other words, they are recruiting their successors in technology the same way they are becoming the successors to those who reached the moon, developed the Space Shuttle, and are now focused on Mars.

They learn.  They succeed.  And they have fun.","[]","[]","null","3,217","null","null","[]","[]","null","1,181","null","null"

A variety of special programs and services are offered in support of undergraduate students. 

The USC Viterbi School of Engineering also supports an interactive online program called DEN@Viterbi, designed to enable part-time students to take courses for graduate credit without commuting frequently to campus. Regular campus classes and non-credit continuing education courses are transmitted from studio classrooms at the USC campus via an extensive webcast system to enable students to access their classes anytime, from anywhere. Live instruction can be highly interactive; students can ask questions and carry on discussions with the instructor by telephone (if watching live) or via threaded online chat discussions. Video conferencing during live instruction is also available upon request. Lectures are archived and are available for viewing again at any time during the semester.

These four-year programs lead to either the B.A. or B.S. degree and may qualify students for further study leading to a fifth-year professional master's degree, an M.A. or M.S. degree, or a Ph.D. degree, all of which are offered at Rice. Students are required to balance engineering and science courses with courses in the liberal arts for a well-rounded education. In addition to having an outstanding engineering school, Rice is also an excellent liberal arts university. Although Rice does not offer co-op programs, most engineering undergraduates gain industrial experience through summer internships. More than 65 percent of Rice engineering undergraduates have participated in research projects by the time they graduate. 

Through rigorous engineering education, involvement in research, and meaningful internships, Rice produces engineering graduates who are exceptionally well-prepared for careers in industry or entry into advanced degree programs.","[{""faculty_departments"":""Type of institution:""},{""faculty_departments"":""Academic Year:""},{""faculty_departments"":""Setting of Main Engineering Campus""}]","[]","null","7,902","null","null","[{""ug_sat"":""Bioengineering""},{""ug_sat"":""Bioengineering (B.S.B.)""},{""ug_sat"":""Biomedical Engineering""},{""ug_sat"":""Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering""},{""ug_sat"":""Chemical Engineering (B.A.)""},{""ug_sat"":""Chemical Engineering""},{""ug_sat"":""Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering""},{""ug_sat"":""Chemical Engineering (B.S.Ch.E.)""},{""ug_sat"":""Chemical Engineering""},{""ug_sat"":""Civil and Environmental Engineering""},{""ug_sat"":""Civil and Environmental Engineering (B.A.)""},{""ug_sat"":""Civil/Environmental Engineering""},{""ug_sat"":""Civil and Environmental Engineering""},{""ug_sat"":""Civil Engineering (B.S.C.E.)""},{""ug_sat"":""Civil Engineering""},{""ug_sat"":""Computational and Applied Mathematics""},{""ug_sat"":""Computational and Applied Mathematics (B.A.)""},{""ug_sat"":""Other Engineering Disciplines""},{""ug_sat"":""Computer Science""},{""ug_sat"":""Computer Science (B.A.)""},{""ug_sat"":""Computer Science (inside engineering)""},{""ug_sat"":""Computer Science""},{""ug_sat"":""Computer Science (B.S.C.S.)""},{""ug_sat"":""Computer Science (inside engineering)""},{""ug_sat"":""Electrical and Computer Engineering""},{""ug_sat"":""Electrical Engineering (B.S.E.E.)""},{""ug_sat"":""Electrical Engineering""},{""ug_sat"":""Electrical and Computer Engineering""},{""ug_sat"":""Electrical Engineering (B.A.)""},{""ug_sat"":""Electrical/Computer Engineering""},{""ug_sat"":""Materials Science and NanoEngineering""},{""ug_sat"":""Materials Science and NanoEngineering (B.A.)""},{""ug_sat"":""Metallurgical and Matrls.

Special opportunities that contribute directly to that goal include our introductory engineering course ENGR100-Exploring Engineering, which gives students not only the opportunity to experience hands-on work in various engineering disciplines, but also explores engineering ethics case studies and culminates in team-based, design-and-build projects.  We also offer opportunities to participate in the Grand Challenge Scholars Program, undergraduate research directly supported by the College and University, semester-length and short-term engineering study-abroad experiences, affinity housing around the theme of Entrepreneurship and Innovation, a special empowerment program known as the Engineering Success Alliance and design and business competitions.  Culminating design experiences offer students the opportunity to work with corporate sponsors experiencing real-world design projects.  Students also have the option of interdisciplinary degree programs in conjunction with the School of Management and other majors across campus.  Students are encouraged to participate in summer internships facilitated by our Career Development Center, and many companies directly recruit on campus for both internships and permanent employment.

The Bucknell engineering curricula offer many integrated laboratory and design experiences in well-equipped undergraduate laboratories, MakerSpaces and project spaces.

The engineering student body at Bucknell is diverse with 60% students of color, international, or women.

Design is composed of a logical process followed to meet a specific need. The design process encompasses most of the following activities: 
1. Identification of a need
2. Problem definition
3. Search or literature review
4. Determination of constraints
5. Identification of criteria that are required and desired of the design
6. Alternative solutions
7. Analysis
8. Decision or selection from a group of potential solutions
9. Specification of the final design, and
10. Communication of the design
(Note: Fabrication of the design is not necessary.)
Research may involve design but it may be distinct from design. For example, the design of an experimental apparatus may be considered design, but the collection and analysis of data is not design.

The distinctive 700 acre suburban campus includes residence halls for 4500 students. Engineering laboratory facilities are modern and equipment is state-of-the-art and feature a cross-disciplinary IDEA Studio invention space. Engineering freshmen need not declare a major at the time of admission. Any of the seven majors may be selected at any time during the freshman year. Freshman with strong high school preparation can complete the B.S. program in 4 years. For a variety of reasons some students choose to extend their programs over 4 1/2 years or 5 years. Such an extension provides more time for in-depth study, part-time employment or active participation in student organizations or athletics. All of the engineering majors offer an accelerated B.S./M.S. option, honors program, undergraduate research and internship experience. An interdisciplinary Ph.D. program in Engineering and Applied Science provides wide-ranging opportunities for graduate study. Biomedical Engineering and Biotechnology M.S. and Ph.D. programs address contemporary biomedical and health research problems and are offered jointly by the UMass campuses of Boston, Dartmouth, Lowell and Worcester (UMass Medical).","[]","[]","null","1,226","null","null","[]","[]","null","301","null","null"

*SOLAR CAR TEAM: 
Gato del Sol is the 1982 Kentucky Derby winning thoroughbred and the namesake for our car. Stone Farm, who raised Gato del Sol, has been a longtime supporter of the University of Kentucky Solar Car Team. Gato, meaning cat in Spanish, and Sol, meaning sun in Spanish, is a very fitting name for Wildcats racing on the power of solar energy.

All majors are invited to join. No prior experience necessary.
Electrical Team �"" Makes the car go
•Integrates the solar array, maximum power point trackers, batteries, and motor controller.
•Sends data from the solar car to chase vehicle’s computer via the telemetry system.
Business �"" Makes the car possible
•Coordinates sponsorship from generous corporations and individuals
•Manages budget of nearly $500,000
•Plans outreach events and produces media (UK Ch. 50 Videos, Website)

The ME team is responsible for the entire physical car �"" the design and construction of the frame or monocoque, structural integrity and the aerodynamics of the top and bottom shells, suspension, steering, brakes, roll cage, etc.  There is also a CS team that programs and optimizes the motor controls, data collection, and data processing to maximize the efficiency of the car.


*BIG BLUE BAJA TEAM: 
Baja SAE consists of three regional competitions that simulate real-world engineering design projects and their related challenges. Engineering students are tasked to design and build an off-road vehicle that will survive the severe punishment of rough terrain and sometimes even water.

The object of the competition is to provide SAE student members with a challenging project that involves the planning and manufacturing tasks found when introducing a new product to the consumer industrial market. Teams compete against one another to have their design accepted for manufacture by a fictitious firm. Students must function as a team to not only design, build, test, promote, and race a vehicle within the limits of the rules, but also to generate financial support for their project and manage their educational priorities.

All vehicles are powered by a ten-horsepower Intek Model 20 engine donated by Briggs & Stratton Corporation. For over twenty-five years, the generosity of Briggs & Stratton has enabled SAE to provide each team with a dependable engine free of charge. Use of the same engine by all the teams creates a more challenging engineering design test.


*AVENUE OF CHAMPIONS DESIGN CHALLENGE:
CE 429, Civil Engineering Systems Design, is the capstone design experience for the Civil Engineering program.  Students take this course in their final semester before graduation; it is intended to provide the students a project-based introduction to the planning, assessment, and preliminary design of civil engineering projects.
Currently, the seniors are working with the UK Office of Sustainability to study design options for the Avenue of Champions corridor.  With the recent and ongoing construction of residential halls and the new Student Center along this corridor, the potential for pedestrian and vehicle conflicts has increased.  The students are challenged to develop and assess alternative scenarios for closing all or portions of the corridor for a pedestrian plaza; design considerations must include traffic impacts, safety improvements, site layout, environmental considerations, construction cost, and others.


*WILDCAT PULLING TEAM:
The ASABE International 1/4 Scale Tractor Student Design Competition gives students a comprehensive perspective on what it takes to design, build, test and market a product. Each year, universities across the United States and Canada compete for top honors in design and performance categories. Teams are also judged by a panel of industry experts on a written report and an oral presentation. All teams are given a 31 hp Briggs & Stratton engine and a set of Titan tires �"" the rest is up to them.
The University of Kentucky Wildcat Pulling Team has fielded an entry every year since 1999 and won the competition in 2012, 2014 and 2015. The latest designs have used a custom-tuned continuously variable transmission in series with a 3-speed manual transaxle to maximize power transfer while keeping the tractor safe and easy to drive. The diverse team includes students across multiple departments from the College of Engineering and the College of Agriculture, Food and Environment.


*SME/NSSGA STUDENT DESIGN COMPETITION: 
The Student Design Competition is a two-phase competition involving a technical design component and an oral presentation. The competition is based on a real problem from the aggregate mining industry sector. 

The first Stage is an on‐campus, “set time limit” competition during the fall semester. The purpose of the first Stage is to simulate an engineering solution prepared for the chief engineer of a company.  Judges selected from the industry (ten) will evaluate the written solutions, which will make up 40% of the final score.

From the first phase, six teams are selected, and during the Second phase, held at the SME Annual Conference and Expo, each team will receive modifications to the original problem. The teams need to prepare an oral presentation to a panel of judges describing their solution. The purpose of the Second Stage is to simulate a presentation to a board of directors. The score from the second Stage will reflect 60% of the final score. The top three high scoring teams (combined Stage 1 and Stage 2 scores) will receive awards for the first, second, and third place. The University of Kentucky Mining Department team has been competing since the beginning of this competition in 2004 and has been placed second and first place in 2016 and 2017 respectively.


*GOODMAN GOLD CHALLENGE (Laurentian University, Sudbury, Canada):
The Goodman Gold Challenge (GGC) is a unique investment mining management competition for undergraduate students. Unlike other competitions, participants will evaluate the investment potential of three gold companies currently trading on the TSX or TSX-V and recommend to their top tier clients, a single company for their portfolio. The challenge provides undergraduate students with real-life experience, putting their academic credentials to a vital test. The challenge offers students a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to interview three gold mining company CEOs about the current and projected financial strength of their company and decide whether they belong on your tier one client list. The student’s performance could win their team the cash equivalent of four (4) ounces of gold. The University of Kentucky Mining Department team has been competing since the beginning of this competition in 2016 and placed second that year.


*PROJECT GREEN CHALLENGE (CME 470 �"" Environmental Ethics Project

This will be accomplished by designing a smart car seat that will signal nearby people and the parents when a child is left in the car. The device will use sensors to detect a child in the seat and use audio and visual alerts so that anyone in the immediate area will become aware that a child is locked in the car. 


*LED �"" I SEE THE LIGHT
The objective of this project is to look at what the capabilities LEDs have as light detectors. They are not optimized for this task but have been shown to yield good results when used under various conditions for differing experiments. The use of the LEDs as a camera is a simple idea that holds a lot of potential moving forward. For our purposes, the overall goal is to create an LED light sensing array that is able to capture and produce an image file. The image will be created using the voltage values from each LED recorded as bit values through an arduino and then converted into pixels through Matlab. This image will be displayed on a computer screen. A stretch goal for this project will be using the LED array as a projector to project the captured image.


*STEEL
While marksmanship is a source pride for many sport-shooters, hunters, police officers, and military personnel, the tactical training industry remains untouched by modern technology. Even with today’s advanced weaponry, target practice is often carried out using a rudimentary steel plate or paper target -- 
offering limited insight to the actual skill of the shooter. Our team’s objective is to bring the experience of tactical training into the 21st century by developing a “smart” target practice system. Our solution will give marksmen real-time data pertaining to their spatial and temporal accuracy.


*PLC PROS
The purpose of this project is to update the control system, both hardware and software, for the Henry Filtration machine at North American Stainless (NAS). This new control system will allow technicians at NAS to troubleshoot and maintain the system if faults were to occur, the current system does not have this capability. This will be aided by new electrical schematics and copies of the updated code to replace the existing contaminated documentation. 
This new system will also have the ability to supporting a HMI (Human Machine Interface) as a replacement for the current push button control station. 


*IT'S ELECTRIC
Our senior project is to design a fully electric outboard boat motor. The idea came about as a couple of us were out fishing one day. Our initial thought came from the intense sun that beat down on us, and how that energy could be transformed into power through the use of a small solar array on top of the motor. As a group, we feel as if this project would be both beneficial and relatable. This project gives us the ability to apply concepts from our classes into a real-world application. It may be a small boat motor, but if done correctly could turn into an entrepreneurship experience. We feel strongly that this project will test our knowledge of past and present classes and help us create a product that could change the game of energy efficient fishing.


*WAVEBUSTERS
Dynetics has requested for a senior design team to build a device that performs three main functions. 
The first and primary function of this device is to listen to the environment and collect signals using an RF sensor. Second, the team will develop an automated signal characterization method for the analysis of the captured signals. Lastly, the device must be capable of generating real-time displays of the detected signals.


*THE STRATONEERS
The Kentucky Re-entry Universal Payload System (KRUPS) is a capsule that will be launched into the atmosphere this Spring. This project has been ongoing for multiple years, this year the University of Kentucky faculty mentors and advisors have tasked Electrical, Mechanical, and Computer Science students with improving on the KRUPS atmospheric re-entry capsule.  The objective of this project is to improve upon the power, control, and communications systems that have been implemented in past years. The communications and controls will transmit data to the ground when the capsule is released into the atmosphere. The power supply will need to be able to keep the controls and communications energized throughout the entire re-entry process, along with being the correct size.


*DC/AC
This project follows the task of building a power inverter that consumes power from a bank of batteries and produces alternating current at 120V with the ability to sustain 1kW RMS. This project will be incorporated into the University of Kentucky’s Solar Car build for events and showings. This inverter will permit direct current, incoming from the solar car’s battery bank, to be converted to alternating current. By coupling the inverter with the UK Solar Team’s display, they will be able to run a plethora of helpful electrical aides off of the vehicle’s batteries, generally reserved for propulsion.


*AUTONOMOUS DEBRIS ROBOT (Space Class) �"" ADR-S
The IEEE SoutheastCon Hardware competition has developed a futuristic situation in which an autonomous debris collecting robot is required. The purpose of this robot is to transport and sort color coded obstacles on a playing field.  The objective of this project is to design and build an autonomous, self-contained robot that will transport and sort color coded obstacles out of a designated quadrant of the orbital zone (defined by colored lines) on the playing field described above. The robot shall also avoid blinking lights that represent geostationary Spacetels and move back to a home base docking space to raise a flag. This exercise will simulate the space debris cleaning scenario.


*MAX POWER �"" MAXIMUM POWER POINT TRACKER
The purpose of this project is to design and build a device/algorithm that is responsible for controlling the maximum power that is available from the sun, the Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT). This project was commissioned by University of Kentucky’s Solar Car Team. Their current vehicle uses an off-the-shelf MPPT, but they are re-configuring their solar car to feature more student-built components. While this project is catered for the Solar Car Team, solar energy has grown to be a more efficient, affordable, and environment friendly source of energy so this technology can be used for many purposes in the solar power field.


*rPPG �"" BIOSENSING WITH A CAMERA
There is an ever-present need for the efficient, safe, and ethical collection of biomedical data. The product we intend to market will perform a non-contact, sanitary, and accurate measurement of a subject’s heart rate. Remote measurement ensures contact with contagious patients can be avoided and allows data to be collected in cases where a patient or individual is hazardous to interact with or impossible reach. 

The objective of this project is to design software to be implemented on any camera that supports CHDK, the Canon Hack Development Kit. The finished product will include complete instructions to ensure that installation will be simple, and operation will be intuitive with minimal programming experience. The software will utilize a camera’s built-in facial tracking feature to identify subjects to measure heartbeats, with the finished product able to analyze three faces simultaneously. All processing to identify heart rate will be done within the camera and will be conducted in real-time. Special attention will also be directed to the ethical implications of the device, due to the possibility to access private information without the consent of the patient. To combat this, the software will not save any data that it processes, and it will not support any wireless connectivity as well.","[]","[]","null","2,769","null","null","[]","[]","null","441","null","null"

All aerospace engineering students are required to take a sequence of design courses, including aerospace structural design, and a two-semester sequence of either aircraft design or spacecraft design. 
In the structural design course, teams of three students apply the topics covered in the course to design, based on a combined figure of merit, an optimum set of stringers to stiffen an 18 x 24 x 0.032 in. 2024-T3 aluminum sheet that can support a specified design ultimate load (typically 12,000-18,000 lb) in axial compression. As part of this project, students evaluate different stringer design concepts; develop an algorithm for analysis of different failure modes; write an analysis program in a computer language of their choice; determine the optimum size, quantity, and arrangement of stringers; find the minimum number of fasteners; fabricate one panel per student; and then test each panel to failure in a laboratory setting. Teams submit detailed written reports and give oral presentations to complete the project. 
Both an aeronautics and an astronautics concentration are offered in our program, and each requires senior students to complete a two-semester sequence covering systems engineering and industry practices in design of either an airplane design or a spacecraft design as appropriate. Team-based design projects are conducted, with the bulk of the design work done during the second semester and presentation and defense of the team’s work being an important element.  
Additionally, all aerospace engineering students take a two semester laboratory course that requires an individual research project.  Student work is overseen by faculty advisors, and the results of the research are documented in a technical report and presentation.  

BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING:
Students in the 2-semester sequence senior design course work in teams to complete, construct, and test the design of a device for biological or biomedical applications. This course includes an innovative entrepreneurial aspect. Along with all completing a systematic approach to engineering design, teams provide a detailed budget and marketing plan for all devices developed. The MSU Entrepreneurship office hosts a biomedical business plan competition for students within the senior design course. Interested teams are invited to the competition and the top three teams are provided cash prizes. Entrepreneurs from around Mississippi judge the student teams. Design projects change on an annual basis. Although the problems are biological/biomedical in nature, the students rely heavily on mechanical, electrical engineering, and mathematical principles for their design solutions. Sample bioengineering problem statements are as follows:
•	A murmur detecting electronic stethoscope: A stethoscope with an embedded artificial neural network that allows a physician not only to hear heartbeat, but also detect if there is a murmur. 
•	Double Heartbeat Detector: an ingestible wireless capsule that monitors an animal in gestation. It tells when the first double-heart beat was detected and provide a digital recording of the event.
•	A rapid blood typing instrument: An automated low-cost instrument that can determine blood type in less than two minutes. 
•	Automated hydroponic growth system for high value plants: Utilizing color LED lighting system with automation to control the growth environment of plant to increase production efficiency and yield. A technology that is applicable for Vertical Farming, which vegetables and fruits are grown inside containers will artificial lightings.
•	Disposable One-Time Use Inhaler: single-shot inhaler and apparatus the make it practical to carry in a pocket and can be rapidly deployed in time of need.
•	Rapid Gage for Orthopedic Operation: a simple gaging apparatus that can determine the precise length of screw needed in an orthopedic surgery operation quickly.

CIVIL ENGINEERING:
Concrete Canoe - The project is to design and build a four-person racing canoe using concrete as the primary construction material. The overall geometry and basic materials criteria are specified by the American Society of Civil Engineers' National Concrete Canoe Committee. A suitable construction jig and form must be designed. A concrete reinforcing system and mix must be developed. The material must have a sustainable component. Once completed, the canoe is raced in five races: men's slalom, men's sprint, women's slalom, women's sprint, and co-ed slalom. The competition also involves the construction of a display, preparation and submission of a written design report, and the presentation of the design report to a panel of judges. These components are evaluated by a panel of professionals. This is an annual project. This year the students finished second in the regional competition and tied Texas A&M and NJIT for 19th at the national competition.
Steel Bridge - This project involves design, fabrication and competitive erection of bridge structure using steel in accordance with the rules developed by the American Institute for Steel Construction (AISC). The structure must span a pre-defined distance between four to six meters and carry eccentrically-placed vertical loads of 1,500 pounds and horizontal loads of 150 pounds. The bridge is evaluated by a team of professionals on vertical and lateral deflection under load, cost, constructability, construction time and aesthetics. This is an annual project. The team finished fourth at the regional competition.  This was due, in part, to a deviation in loading made by the site judges which contradicted the national rules and competition policies. 
Timber Bridge �"" This project involves the design, fabrication and testing of a prototype bridge in which the primary building material is wood. Only fasteners made of metal are allowed. This is sponsored by the Southwest Mississippi Resource Conservation and Development (RC&D), Inc., a rural development program focusing on natural resources development. The corporate sponsor is Bell Structural Solutions in Minnesota and the competition is also endorsed by ASCE's Structural Engineering Institute (SEI). The wood used in this project must be from a commercially available species and treated to AWPA standards. Bridge members cannot contact with the ground. Design span was 3.8 meters with a maximum individual piece length of 2.1 meters and maximum width of supporting base plates at 60 mm. The structure is loaded at 5-kN increments up to 20kN and held at this peak load for one hour. Deflection is measured for each load increment and over the sustained peak load. Evaluation is based on bridge performance, a design report, design drawings, and constructability. In 2015 MSU ASCE Chapter finished first in deflection and esthetics, had the highest percent wood in the structure, and finished third overall in the National Timber Bridge Design Competition.
Environmental and Water Resources Laboratory - The environmental and water resources laboratory is conducted with undergraduate students serving as experimental designer. Students select topics of interest and design research experiments, under the supervision of the instructor, to investigate the topic. The students design and construct the test apparatus, develop the data collection protocol, prepare the necessary materials, and supervise the experiments.
Construction Materials Laboratory �"" The undergraduate laboratory on construction materials provides students with a background in codes, building materials, pavement materials, aggregates, testing methods defined by ASTM and ACI.  To provide synthesis of this knowledge, the students work in teams to design a material to meet a specific hypothetical project need, test their design, and give an oral and written presentation which is judged by a group of professionals, graduate students, and upper-level undergraduates.
Civil Engineering Comprehensive �"" The course covers topics related to project management, the business of engineering, public policy, leadership and professional ethics.  A portion of the curriculum emphasizes the importance of professional licensure and the legal, technical and professional issues related to the practice of engineering.  The course provides students an opportunity to demonstrate that they can interpret and apply data to design a civil engineering system that must include principles of sustainability.  This project exposes students to the team design approach on a diverse set of multidisciplinary projects. Students plan, design and evaluate construction management requirements for the system. The design includes environmental and water resources site assessments, engineering of structural, hydraulic, environmental, geotechnical, and materials systems which are required for the complete project functionality. Preliminary plans and specifications are developed. Presentations and project posters are presented in a competitive format to a jury of professional engineers, public officials, private citizens, and faculty.  Recent projects have included municipal land development project which included a public use areas with an amphitheater and commercial development zone, a campus-wide water reuse and reclamation project which eliminated stormwater releases, and a microbrewery with restaurant and self-contained water purification and wastewater reused system.  

CHEMICAL ENGINEERING:
The AIChE Car Competition - Comprising student members from all ranks, the objective of this competition is: (1) To provide chemical engineering students with the opportunity to participate in a team-oriented hands-on design and construction of a small chemical powered model car. (2) To design and construct a car that is powered with a chemical energy source that will carry a specified load over a given distance and stop. (3) To encourage students to become actively involved in their professional society. (4) To increase awareness of the chemical engineering discipline among the general public, industry leaders, educators and other students. The team works on planning and design throughout the fall semester and constructing and testing in the early spring semester. The competition is first held at the regional level (for us, the Southern Region of the United States and Puerto Rico). The top five teams from the Southern Region are allowed to compete in the national contest. Our AICHE chapter has an active team planning for the spring 2016 competition.
The Chemical Engineering capstone plant design course requires groups of students to design a chemical plant to include technically- and economically-viable solutions. The open-ended projects are intended to test the ability of the students in the teams to synthesize a ""best"" solution from among the myriad of possible solutions. Each year the topic of the design problem changes and can include the AIChE design problem which is sponsored by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers. One best solution to this problem can be entered into this contest for consideration by the national committee. The top design solution is announced each year at the annual meeting of the AIChE held in November. In 2011, MSU student teams placed first and third in the national competition.   Each year, our program submits top performing team designs submitted during the plant design course to the national competition.
Separation Processes: A design project is given (spanning the last month of the semester) where students are given a multicomponent stream that they must design a separation process for that satisfies multiple constraints. For example, in a three component stream, they must produce two streams of given purities, while minimizing costs. The chemical system/composition chosen is always one where the constraints/purities cannot be met by simple manipulation of a single tower. This is typically a real world problem, with reflux ratios and production capacities typical of those seen in a petrochemical complex. Students must not only sequence the separations, meeting the constraints, but must also size the column(s) (determine column diameter, height), choose the type of column internals (tray or packed), size condenser and reboiler (determine heat transfer area) given available utilities; and cost these items. They are required to produce a design report where they discuss their design, providing the rationale and supporting evidence for their design decisions.  Two examples are given below.
•	Styrene from Ethylbenzene:  This project involved separating styrene and ethylbenzene from a stream of seven components. A key constraint was that the styrene temperature had to remain lower than 125 oC to avoid spontaneous polymerization.  
•	Cumene from Propylene and Benzene:  This project involved separating cumene and benzene from a 4 component mixture.  The purity of the cumene stream was specified, and the benzene stream had to contain less than 0.01 mole fraction of cumene.  
Reactor Design: A design project is given where students are given a feed stock, and a reaction scheme (always multiple reactions, at least one desirable product; at least one undesirable product; in some cases, desirable product may undergo secondary reaction). Students are only given a temperature and pressure at which feedstock is stored. They must decide what type of reactor to use (CSTR, PFR), what feed conditions should be used (T0, P0, feed volumetric flowrate), how the reactor should operate (isothermal, adiabatic, nonisothermal/nonadiabatic), whether inert material should be co-fed. They are given information about available utilities for heating and cooling. They are required to produce a design report where they discuss their design, providing rationale and supporting evidence for their design decisions. A grading rubric is provided to the students at the start of each project, so they are very aware of what elements must be included in the report, and at what level information must be provided and presented to achieve a satisfactory grade.
Process Design: Typically, three projects are given over the course of the semester. The first project usually focuses on a comparison of two design alternatives (which is most economically/technically better). The second project focuses on an existing process, which must be altered to either increase or decrease production capacity (a Debottlenecking/troubleshooting problem). The third project typically involves considering the inclusion of novel technologies for process improvement - for example, including gas permeation units to recover hydrogen and thereby, reduce hydrogen feedstock requirements; also, looking at heat integration for energy savings. Each project is completed in approximately three weeks; design reporting requirements differ from first to last project, so that students develop expertise in producing the different required elements in a design report.
Fluid Flow and Heat Transfer: Working in teams of people with different motivations, attitudes, and personalities is an integral part of the engineering profession and it is also commonplace that chemical engineers thrust into leadership positions. Therefore, group design projects were assigned for the Fluid Flow Operations (CHE 3203) and Heat Transfer Operations (CHE 3213) classes. Each individual member of the team could contribute their own creative ideas to the overall work and should also be accountable to each other in order to ensure team success and productivity. The projects are open-ended equipment design problems involving a specific engineering problem or equipment requirement needing application of chemical engineering principles and fundamentals, as well as engineering design heuristics and data on reference materials such as Perry’s Chemical Engineering Handbook. Students in the Fluid Flow Operations class were tasked with designing a fluid flow system consisting of a pump, pipeline, storage tank, and delivery system that would harvest a liquid with a given set of chemical properties from an underground reservoir and deliver it to consumers in a nearby building at a reasonable throughput rate. The students were given the geological data on the depth and volume of the underground liquid reservoir and they were required to design the said flow system that will use the least amount of pumping power possible. This design project problem was revisited during the Heat Transfer class during a following semester in which the students were required to design heat exchange equipment that will cool or heat the harvested liquid to a specified temperature. It was found that the liquid harvested from the underground reservoir was available at a high temperature, at which the liquid is lethal to consumers. The students were required to design a shell and tube heat exchanger based on the required cooled temperature of the liquid by applying the heat transfer concepts learned in class as well as design heuristics for heat exchanger design that were discussed. All projects were constructed as a proposal type document with the aim of selling the design concept to a prospective client. Students were graded individually based on their contributions and as a team for the overall quality of the finished product. This type of projects allows the students to apply the fundamental concepts and engineering principles that they have learned in class; exercise creativity and innovation while keeping in mind the constraints based on economics, sustainability, and ethical considerations; and train themselves in working in teams efficiently and effectively.
CHE 2213 Chemical Engineering Analysis is a three-credit-hour course required in the second semester of the freshman year. Through the use of LEGO®NXT robotics and supporting equipment (pumps, valves, tanks, piping, etc.), CHE 2213 provides students with a highly visual, project-based approach to learning engineering fundamentals. Employing an engineering “design cycle”, student teams collaboratively design, build, test and optimize a chemical process to accomplish a specific task (e.g. liquid level control in a chemical process tank, processing a set of reactants to produce a valuable product, or modifying a process stream to meet certain design specifications). Through the introduction of increasingly complex “team challenges” students are engaged in an integration of communication skills, engineering topics and engineering design principles. Introduction of the design cycle provides teams a guide for solving the problem at hand over successive refinement of their designed solution. The importance of material balances and controlling processes in chemical engineering is emphasized in a series of team challenges integrating the LEGO® NXT system with a bench-scale fluids handling system. A submersible pump delivers a fluid (e.g. water, acid/base, or salt solution) to a tank through a small needle valve controlled by the NXT robotics “Intelligent Brick” (i.e. a 32-bit microprocessor). In the latest iterations of the course, we have strengthened emphasis on process variables/measures (e.g. concentration, pH, temperature, pressure) and material balances. Student teams conduct team challenges using these measures as indicators of “product quality”. For example, one challenge requires feeding de-ionized water and a salt solution from two separate reservoirs to a mixing tank�""maintaining a prescribed salt concentration in the outlet stream (as indicated by a conductivity sensor). Another challenge allows students to feed dilute acid and base solutions (typically vinegar/sodium bicarbonate) to a mixing tank, maintaining a particular pH.
Process Instrumentation and Automatic Control: In CHE 4223, Process Instrumentation and Automatic Control, a design project is given where the students are required to develop a numerical model to simulate the dynamic response of a chemical process to examine various control strategies. The students also utilize Loop-Pro software to control several chemical processes.

COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING:
Each BS curriculum includes a capstone design course, except for Computer Science.

Software Engineering Senior Design Project - The software engineering capstone design experience consists of a two-semester sequence in which students from the software engineering (SE) program in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering team with students f work as an industrial team on a software engineering product for a real customer. Each year, the students in the Software Engineering Senior Design class are charged with developing a system and exercising the entire software engineering lifecycle - from requirements to delivery. During the 2016-17 academic year, the Software Engineering Senior Design course involves four teams working on four different projects. 
2016-2017 projects include the following systems: 
EcoCAR3 ADAS - Mississippi State University's EcoCAR3 team is currently in the 3rd year of the 4-year competition with 15 other universities throughout the US and Canada. The CSE Senior Design team is working to develop and enhance the vehicle's vision-based Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). The team is developing vision processing algorithms to assess real-world traffic and surroundings (e.g., stop signs, speed limit) to enhance driver experience and safety. 
Future Grower Technology - College of Ag and Life Sciences - The goal of the Future Grower program is to develop training systems to teach the next generation of greenhouse and grower house operators how to successfully manage agricultural resources in a safe, non-threatening environment. The team is developing a server-based simulation game to use as a training tool and incorporating actual commercial control interfaces, 3D models of selected plant species, and trainee remote interfaces on iOS and Android mobile platforms. This application will reduce the operator training time by simulating shortened virtual growth cycles.
The FSB Companies Cattle Management System - The FSB Companies is a boutique investment firm that invests in and manages a diverse portfolio of companies at all stages of growth. The FSB portfolio contains agricultural holdings focused on livestock management. The senior design team is developing a full-stack web application with iOS and Android mobile app interfaces to track the status, location and health of managed cattle, straw inventory, and breeding cycles. This system will replace a manual, paper process and allow access to available metrics to enable process improvement.
Camgian Microsystems - Camgian develops advanced sensing and information processing platforms that deliver real-time, actionable intelligence. The CSE Senior design team is supporting development of Camgian's Egburt fog computing software platform providing sensor analytics to its clients. The team is developing algorithms to detect and report correlations between streams of sensor data to alert operators to data anomalies prior to actual disruptions in operations. The system will produce an interactive network map upon anomaly detection that the operator can use to pinpoint the source of any problems.  
CSE 4713 Programming Languages - This class has a semester-long project that involves the design and implementation of a language translation system. This project is required for computer science students and serves to bring together the knowledge from the pre-requisite classes into a semester-long project involving the analysis, parsing and implementation of a model computer language.

ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING:
Both electrical engineering and computer engineering students participate in a two-semester senior design sequence. Student teams are composed of four to six students and are free to choose their own projects. In the first semester, student teams complete a working prototype, with the second semester dedicated to fine-tuning, packaging, and testing of the final design.
Senior design teams compete each year at the IEEE SoutheastCon Hardware Design Competition that has teams from 40+ regional universities, building autonomous robots to perform various tasks. Our ECE student team are placed in the top three positions seven times and secured first place four times. Furthermore, ECE students have also participated in the software and ethics competitions at SoutheastCon. Senior design teams can also be sponsored by external sources such as private companies (e.g., Nissan) and state/federal agencies (e.g., Mississippi Department of Transportation and Army Material Systems Analysis Activity, Proving Ground, Maryland).
Outside of the framework of the senior design sequence, other ECE students are teaming with Aerospace and other engineering students to compete in the annual Student Unmanned Aerial System (SUAS) design competition, sponsored by the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International. This is an international competition where the MSU team has seen success. In addition, Mississippi State University is one of 12 universities in North America participating in the EcoCAR Mobility Challenge. Sponsored by General Motors and the U.S. Department of Energy, the goal of this 4 year-competition is to apply advanced propulsion systems and SAE Level 2 autonomy, combined with V2X connectivity, to improve the energy consumption of a 2019 Chevrolet Blazer -- without compromising the vehicle’s emissions, safety, drivability or utility.
INDUSTRIAL AND SYSTEMS ENGINEERING:
Manufacturing Processes Design Project �"" Industrial engineering students in IE 3323 work in teams to define the sequence of processes, along with specific machines and tooling required to efficiently and economically manufacture a selected commercially available product. 
Systems Simulation I Project - Industrial engineering students in IE 4773 work in teams (undergraduate) or individually (graduate students) to complete a project involving either the solution of an actual manufacturing system problem from industry, or the design of a production or service facility defined in cooperation with the instructor. Each project must involve a detailed analysis of all aspects of the project including problem definition, identification of key performance measures, development of an operational description of the problem, simulation implementation, and model verification and validation. In addition to the intermediate reports submitted during the semester, each project must submit a final report along with their model.  
Senior Design Project - Industrial engineering senior design students work in teams to design a production facility for a product they choose or a service facility for a service they choose. Each team must conduct detailed analyses of all aspects of the proposed venture, including the market for the product, the selection of a site for the facility, fabrication and assembly process design, material handling systems design, facility layout, facility and product safety, and financial analysis.  Each senior design team collaborates with teams from another industrial and systems engineering class, Manufacturing Processes. In addition to intermediate reports submitted during the semester, at the end of the semester students submit a final report and make a presentation to practicing industrial and systems engineers who critique their designs.

MECHANICAL ENGINEERING:
All mechanical engineering students are required to take a series of design courses. Among these are machine design, energy system design (ESD) and mechanical system design (MSD). The last two are considered the capstone courses in the curriculum. In MSD, students work in teams of 4 to 7 students. Each team is assigned an industry project, and a proposal and final report are required. In addition, the students are required to deliver a design review/update presentation as well as a final presentation. Use of computer aided engineering tools like finite element analysis (FEA) is an integral part of the project as well as the use of engineering standards. Other activities include peer evaluations and team building exercises.
SAE Formula Car. The Mechanical Engineering student section of the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) annually designs, builds, and races a formula car in the International SAE competition. A team of approximately 35 students are involved every year with this project. Almost half of these students assume a leading role for one aspect of the project (e.g. powertrain, chassis, body). The completed car and team travel to race location to participate in the competition in the Spring semester each year. Funding for the project comes from corporations, alumni, private donors, the Mechanical Engineering Department, the Bagley College of Engineering, and Mississippi State University.
EcoCAR: Mobility Challenge.  MSU is one of twelve university teams competing in this newest four-year advanced vehicle technology competition (AVTC), managed by Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), General Motors and Mathworks. As the premier collegiate automotive engineering competition in North America, the EcoCAR: Mobility Challange provides MSU students the opportunity to apply advanced propulsion systems and SAE Level 2 autonomy, combined with V2X connectivity, to improve the energy consumption of a 2019 Chevrolet Blazer - without compromising the vehicle’s emissions, safety, drivability or utility. The newest EcoCAR team seeks to build on the strong foundation for success established by its predecessors.

ASME Human Powered Vehicle Challenge (HPVC). The Mechanical Engineering student section of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers annually designs, builds, and races a practical, eco-friendly transportation by means of human powered vehicles. A team of approximately 15 students are involved every year with this project.  About 5 or 6 of the students assume a leading role for one aspect of the project (e.g. composites, innovation, safety, design).  The completed bike and team travel to race location to participate in the competition in the Spring semester each year.  Funding for the project comes from corporations, alumni, private donors, the Mechanical Engineering Department, the Bagley College of Engineering, and Mississippi State University.","[]","[]","null","3,672","null","null","[]","[]","null","495","null","null"
