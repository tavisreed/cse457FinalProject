    <h2><u>Background and Motivation:</u></h2>
        <p>Choosing a university to attend for an undergraduate or graduate degree can be very difficult. There are many
            different things that one needs to consider, such as cost of tuition, program size, accreditation, research
            specialties, diversity, and much more. Not only are there many things to consider about each individual school,
            there are also hundreds of schools to consider. As students who have gone through this process, we have an appreciation for
            the stressfulness of this process. Since we are all within the the school of engineering, we have decided to specifically
            focus on making it easier for those interested in studying engineering to get an understanding of what schools in the U.S.
            have to offer and easily comparing primary attributes across schools.</p>

    <h2><u>Project Objectives:</u></h2>
        <p>We are working on developing an exploratory tool that will allow an individual to get a better understanding of
            higher education in engineering in the United States. We envision a user using this visualization either as a way
            to help inform decisions regarding attending a particular institution or to compare one’s own institution to others.
            We will be providing answers to questions like, how much the school cost to attend, what degree programs are available,
            and diversity within the school, as well as how these numbers compare to other schools. Our visualization will answer
            these questions by providing users with an interactive experience that allows them to easily and quickly view relevant
            data on a particular school and compare it to a number of other schools.

            In doing this project, we hope to learn trends within engineering education, such as gender and ethnic breakdowns
            and popularity of different disciplines. We would like to achieve a visualization that allows users to quickly learn
            new things about engineering education in the United States.

            Some benefits of this visualization will be: Easily learn about trends in engineering education, and
            Learn how a particular school compares to all other schools in the U.S.
        </p>


    <h2><u>Data:</u></h2>
        <p>We will be scraping data from the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) website.
            The website has a collection of profiles on most schools with schools of engineering
            that are located in the United States. For some schools they have data from 1998 to 2018.
            The data has been provided to the ASEE from the actual universities, so it should be fairly accurate.
            Each profile contains both general data on that university's school of engineering and segmented data on the
            undergraduate students and graduate students enrolled in the school of engineering. This data is both qualitative,
            such as names of departments and student societies, and quantitative, such as tuition and number of students
            enrolled in each degree program. Each profile contains a lot of data, some of which doesn't make sense to
            visualize, so we will be focusing a subset of this data that will allow us to build a robust visualization
            without overloading the user.

    <h2><u>Data Processing:</u></h2>
        <p>The data from ASEE is already organized in a standardized format, so extracting the data from the website
            should be fairly simple. Since some of the information is qualitative, we may need to find a way to give
            it a numeric value, depending on how we choose to encode this data into a visual element. Also, some schools
            use different names for degrees that are essentially the same, so we will need to identify these and group them
            together whenever necessary. We will need to compute averages, and standard deviations of values like enrollment
            and tuition to aid in comparing a university to all other universities. Data clean up will be implemented within
            in its own function that will run directly after we access that data from the .csv files. All the values that
            need to be computed will also be done in this function, such that all necessary values will be ready to use for
            our visualization functions.</p>

    <h2><u>Visualization Design:</u></h2>
    <p>We will visualize the data at different levels of detail. On a global scale we will visual trends between all
        schools through either a force clustering or a bee swarm chart.
        These clusters will provide marginalized information about the U.S.
        schools as a whole, such as the groups of schools that have tuition in a particular range.
        Clicking on one of these clusters zoom in will lead to a more indepth separation of this data,
        for example showing by what percent there is more males than females for each school. At this level of zoom,
        clicking on a specific school will lead to that school’s profile, where users will be able to visualize stats on
        that specific school. At this level, users will also be able to view trends overtime in the data.

    <h3>Main visualization version 1:</h3>
    <p>The idea with this version is to represent each school as a sphere and let the user pick attributes
        like tuition, or available majors, etc. and the spheres will become grouped based off their similarity within the
        selected attribute. Selecting a group will allow the user to view that group over the given year range and see how
        schools' values differ within their own group. Clicking on school will lead to that school's profile.</p>

    <h3>Main visualization version 2</h3>
    <p>The idea with this version is to place each school on the map of the united states.
    If you click on a state you will zoom in on that state, which will allow you to better view the schools there
    you can brush over states and compare schools within those selected states. Hovering over a school shows its
    information. The state will also be split into regions that va nbe highlighted. Map can show either
    a single year or a range of years</p>

    <h2><u>3/18-4/1 (Milestone 1 Update)</u></h2>
    <h3><u> What we did:</u></h3>
    <p>Collecting the data turned out to be much more time consuming then expected, so the majority of these two weeks
    was spent working on a scraper and the data wrangleing process. We sourced the data from
        <a href="http://profiles.asee.org/">asee.org</a> which, was fairly standardized, but had some edge cases that made
        the collection of some data more difficult to collect (mainly the enrollment by ethnicity, gender, and major). Currently
        we have data on all schools from the years 1999-2018 that are present in all years. Most of the data we collected on
        each school, once wrangled, is fine to use, but there still remains a number of schools that contain "messed up" data.
        We are currently working on improving our scraper and/or our data wrangleing to be able to properly visualize these schools.
        We have implemented some of the visualizations that will be present on the school profiles. We worked on
        the school profiles instead of our main visualization because the school profiles can still work while some of the data
        is "messed up". Our goal is to fix the data this week so we can begin working on the main visualization. We have been working on
        different possible versions for our main visualization, which are shown below.
    </p>
    

    <h2><u>4/1-4/15 (Milestone 2 Update)</u></h2>
    <h3><u> What we did:</u></h3>
    <p> After submitting our first prototype, the secondary school profile visualization, we implemented a year a year chart in this visualization, which 
        allows for the brush selection of the data between the years 1999 to 2018. Brushing has been implemented to snap to each year interval i.e. the interval between 2016 to 2017 os 
        selected as a whole, rather than it being able to select specific dates in between. The year chart was then linked to the various area charts and line on the school profile
        visualization so that on selection, the data displayed will reflect the timespan selected. We have also implemented our main visualization, a cluster graph. The cluster is a force 
        chart with each node representing a school. The size of each node is representative of the total enrollment of each school. The size is determined using a D3 power scale with exponent 0.5. To help compare node size, a legend has also been implemented
        a school can be searched by name using an input field equipped with auto complete functionality. The school is then highlighted with a black stroke. Clicking on a node will then switch tabs over to the school profile of the selected
        school. Clicking on nodes is our main method of navigating to the the school profile. The main visualization also allows for the clustering of the nodes by specific attributes at the click of a button.
        The main visualization only represents the school data for the year 2018. Our third visualization, located under the trends tab, takes the aggregate data for all schools for a selected
        span of years, selected via year chart. The data represented includes area charts that show divisions of engineering schools gender breakdowns by class, engineering schools racial/ethnic makeup, 
        as well as average tuition and total enrollment of engineering schools. These charts are separated on a public school vs. private school basis. Our fourth visualization, under the school comparison tab, allows for the comparison of two
        selected schools. The visualization displays the type of school (public or private) selected, the tuition of the school, and stacked bar graphs for type of enrollment (grad vs undergrad), enrollment by gender, and enrollment by ethnicity.

    <h2><u>4/15-4/29 (User Studies Update)</u></h2>
    <h3><u> What we did:</u></h3>
    <p>
        We started out with user testing. The questions we asked and people's responses can be seen below.
        We decided to implement some of the feedback we got, but not all of it. We added labels in the clustering
        so that it was easier for users to understand what each node and cluster represented.
        We also added a tooltip when the stacked area chart and stacked bar charts are hovered over,
        as a better way to display what each section represents. We labeled the axes of our charts as well
        as picked a better color scheme for our charts. Users found navigating the page somewhat confusing, as they
        kept hitting the back button, which took them out of the page as all the content is on a singular page. We updated
        the order of the tabs and renamed a few, but overall keep navigation the same as if we had multiple pages to allow for
        the use of a back button we would have had to load the data again. We also choose to make some changes that were not suggested during
        user testing, but we felt would improve the overall user experience. These changes included reformatting
        the school comparison tab, adding a search bar to the school profiles page, and interpolating to
        estimate some missing values. We also updated the font used and made many small stylistic improvements.
