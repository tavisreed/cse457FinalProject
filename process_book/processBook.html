    <h2><u>3/18-4/1</u></h2>
    <h3><u> What we did:</u></h3>
    <p> Collecting the data turned out to be much more time consuming then expected, so the majority of these two weeks
    was spent working on a scraper and the data wrangleing process. We sourced the data from
        <a href="http://profiles.asee.org/">asee.org</a> which, was fairly standardized, but had some edge cases that made
        the collection of some data more difficult to collect (mainly the enrollment by ethnicity, gender, and major). Currently
        we have data on all schools from the years 1999-2018 that are present in all years. Most of the data we collected on
        each school, once wrangled, is fine to use, but there still remains a number of schools that contain "messed up" data.
        We are currently working on improving our scraper and/or our data wrangleing to be able to properly visualize these schools.
        We have implemented some of the visualizations that will be present on the school profiles. We worked on
        the school profiles instead of our main visualization because the school profiles can still work while some of the data
        is "messed up". Our goal is to fix the data this week so we can begin working on the main visualization. We have been working on
        different possible versions for our main visualization, which are shown below.
    </p>

    <h3>Main visualization version 1:</h3>
    <p>The idea with this version is to represent each school as a sphere and let the user pick attributes
        like tuition, or available majors, etc. and the spheres will become grouped based off their similarity within the
        selected attribute. Selecting a group will allow the user to view that group over the given year range and see how
        schools' values differ within their own group. Clicking on school will lead to that schools profile</p>

    <h3>Main visualization version 2</h3>
    <p>The idea with this version is to place each school on the map of the united states.
    If you click on a state you will zoom in on that state, which will allow you to better view the schools there
    You can brush over states and compare schools within those selected states. Hovering over a school shows its
    information. The state will also be split into regions that va nbe highlighted. Map can show either
    a single year or a range of years</p>
