    <h2><u>3/18-4/1</u></h2>
    <h3><u> What we did:</u></h3>
    <p> Collecting the data turned out to be much more time consuming then expected, so the majority of these two weeks
    was spent working on a scraper and the data wrangleing process. We sourced the data from
        <a href="http://profiles.asee.org/">asee.org</a> which, was fairly standardized, but had some edge cases that made
        the collection of some data more difficult to collect (mainly the enrollment by ethnicity, gender, and major). Currently
        we have data on all schools from the years 1999-2018 that are present in all years. Most of the data we collected on
        each school, once wrangled, is fine to use, but there still remains a number of schools that contain "messed up" data.
        We are currently working on improving our scraper and/or our data wrangleing to be able to properly visualize these schools.
        We have implemented some of the visualizations that will be present on the school profiles. We worked on
        the school profiles instead of our main visualization because the school profiles can still work while some of the data
        is "messed up". Our goal is to fix the data this week so we can begin working on the main visualization. We have been working on
        different possible versions for our main visualization, which are shown below.
    </p>

    <h3>Main visualization version 1:</h3>
    <p>The idea with this version is to represent each school as a sphere and let the user pick attributes
        like tuition, or available majors, etc. and the spheres will become grouped based off their similarity within the
        selected attribute. Selecting a group will allow the user to view that group over the given year range and see how
        schools' values differ within their own group. Clicking on school will lead to that schools profile</p>

    <h3>Main visualization version 2</h3>
    <p>The idea with this version is to place each school on the map of the united states.
    If you click on a state you will zoom in on that state, which will allow you to better view the schools there
    you can brush over states and compare schools within those selected states. Hovering over a school shows its
    information. The state will also be split into regions that va nbe highlighted. Map can show either
    a single year or a range of years</p>

    <h2><u>4/1-4/15</u></h2>
    <h3><u> What we did:</u></h3>
    <p> After submitting our first prototype, the secondary school profile visualization, we implemented a year a year chart in this visualization, which 
        allows for the brush selection of the data between the years 1999 to 2018. Brushing has been implemented to snap to each year interval i.e. the interval between 2016 to 2017 os 
        selected as a whole, rather than it being able to select specific dates in between. The year chart was then linked to the various area charts and line on the school profile
        visualization so that on selection, the data displayed will reflect the timespan selected. We have also implemented our main visualization, a cluster graph. The cluster is a force 
        chart with each node representing a school. The size of each node is representative of the total enrollment of each school. The size is determined using a D3 power scale with exponent 0.5. To help compare node size, a legend has also been implemented
        a school can be searched by name using an input field equipped with auto complete functionality. The school is then highlighted with a black stroke. Clicking on a node will then switch tabs over to the school profile of the selected
        school. Clicking on nodes is our main method of navigating to the the school profile. The main visualization also allows for the clustering of the nodes by specific attributes at the click of a button.
        The main visualization only represents the school data for the year 2018. Our third visualization, located under the trends tab, takes the aggregate data for all schools for a selected
        span of years, selected via year chart. The data represented includes area charts that show divisions of engineering schools gender breakdowns by class, engineering schools racial/ethnic makeup, 
        as well as average tuition and total enrollment of engineering schools. These charts are separated on a public school vs. private school basis. Our fourth visualization, under the school comparison tab, allows for the comparison of two
        selected schools. The visualization displays the type of school (public or private) selected, the tuition of the school, and stacked bar graphs for type of enrollment (grad vs undergrad), enrollment by gender, and enrollment by ethnicity.

    <h2><u>4/15-4/29</u></h2>
    <h3><u> What we did:</u></h3>
    <p>
        We started out with user testing. The questions we asked and people's responses can be seen below.
        We decided to implement some of the feedback we got, but not all of it. We added labels in the clustering
        so that it was easier for users to understand what each node and what each cluster represented.
        We also added a tooltip when the stacked area chart and stacked bar charts are hovered over,
        as a better way to display what each section represents. We labeled the axis of our charts as well
        as picked a better color scheme for our charts. Users found navigating the page somewhat confusing, as they
        kept hitting the back button, which took them out of the page as all the content is on a singular page. We updated
        the order of the tabs and renamed a few, but overall keep navigation the same as if we had multiple pages to allow for
        the use of a back button we would have had to load the data again, which takes a long time and
        can disrupt the user experience. We also choose to make some changes that were not suggested during
        user testing, but we felt would improve the overall user experience. These changes included reformatting
        the school comparison tab, adding a search bar to the school profiles page, and interpolating to
        estimate some missing values.
